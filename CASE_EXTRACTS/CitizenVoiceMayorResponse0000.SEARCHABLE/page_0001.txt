a
commendations for their ef-
forts to improve educational ©
opportunities for Kentucky
children. The public should
accept the changes as a begin-
ning and not as a solution to
the problems. ©
Itis generally accepted that
money alone will not do the
job, and the current session of
the legislature has been ac-
ting accordingly, but even the
changes made can stand a lot
of future improvement.
Basically, it's the system
that needs changing. The old
political spoils system is still
too prevalent at the grass
roots level and reaches up
through the State Superinten-
dent's office. It also
penetrates the colleges and
universities.
‘The fact must be recognized
that it is going to take some
years to do this. Expecting too
much of the current actions
can be a big mistake that
could be very‘harmful in the
future.
The governor and others
are claiming the present ef-
fort is the greatest effort for
improvement in the system,
but there/are others who will
argue with this.
Some will claim that chang-
ing from the school age cen-
sus method to the average

tion for distributing state aid
to local schools was the most

progressive step. This put
thousands of children in
classrooms across that state
that-had been left out before.
‘The incentive for politically
motivated superintendents
then was that he would have
more money to spend
elsewhere if children were not
_ in the classrooms.
Kentucky is such a political
state that it
is going
to take a
lot. of time to correct these
ills. It goes back to the early
days when the sheriff was a
kingpin in the county for he
was the chief law enforce-
ment officer and tax collec-
tor. This gave him power.
Next, in line was the county
judge, working in tandem
with the sheriff created a
powerful duo and it wasn’t
hard to draw in the county at-
torney.
The tax assessor also had a
lot of power for he had a str-
ing on the pocketbooks of the
property owners and he cur-
ried their favor.
It didn’t take the school
superintendent long to gain
power in terms of years for in
many counties he and the
school boards controlled the
largest single payroll. This
combination formed the.
“courthouse’”’ gang that had
waning.
The Kentucky Education
Association has not escaped
the political arena. KEA
celebrated its 100th anniver-
Bary in 1957. College
-presidents first controlled it
even though there were not
annual meetings in some of
those early years.
Then, school
superintendents gained con-
trol, until the principals took
over and now the classroom
teachers who finance it with
their dues are in control, so to
speak.
But the superintendent and
school boards at the local
level still are the single most
dominant force in the state’s
education system and this is
where politics is played the
hardest because in some
cases they are still the largest
single employer in the county
with the largest payroll and
respected buying power.
All of the laws pertaining to
schools and their operations
have been influenced in one
way or another by one educa-
tion group or another. And
don’t overlook regulations to
implement these laws are
drafted through or influenced
by the state superintendent's
office which in turn is in-
fluenced by local
superintendents.
‘These can't be eliminated,
but the system can be improv-
ed which leaves a lot of work
\yet to be done.
Pigs make muddy creeks.
The Reverend Dr. Bill Ar-
nold of the Irvine United
Methodist Church recently
told a group of children a
story about soul cleansing.
That hardly qualifies as a
revelation, I'll admit, but it
was an interesting story
nonetheless, because of its
universal appeal and
usefulness.
Even that is not surprising
if you've heard many of those
analogies that ministers are
so good at relating, especially
this minister.
Sometimes I wonder if Dr.
Arnold, or any of his contem-
poraries, might have access
to a book filled with ap-
propriate parallels, complete
with a subject index. It might
~ John
be entitled “‘Short Stories for
Sermons,” or something on
that order.
But if I know Bill, and I
think I know him well enough
to dispense with the for-
malities, he made this up.
There's no doubt that he’s
capable of such creative ex-
pression. I know imagination
when I see it.
Since I consider the mana
friend, ‘I’m sure he won't
mind my playful and public
disection of his tale.
In other words, I'm going to
steal his material.
Anyway, back to the story.
It seems there was a city
boy who moved to the coun-
try.
(i can relate to that, being
from the city. But what wor-
ried me was the fact that I'd
heard many a bad joke with
just such a lead-in).
This city boy bought a
respectable parcel of land,
and built a house near a
creek.
He felt he could enjoy coun-
try life even more if he had a
swimming pool, and set out to
have one built.
How nice it would be, he
thought, if he could fill the

To the Editor
Dear Editor,
In response to the letter by
Agnes Moore in July 18 issue
of the Citizen’s Voice and
Times, first of all, we are all
troubled over the brutal
murder of a young girl.
Criminal investigation
work is a slow, drawn out pro-
cess. It does not happen in
real life as it'does on televi-
sion series.
Please consider the follow-
ing: (1) The murder in-
vestigation is being conducted
by the Kentucky State Police
Department. They are
responsible for the investiga-
tion and if they feel the need
to brief other officers, they
will do so; (2) The murder isa
high priority to everyone, in-
Giuding myself as a citizen
and the mayor of the City of Ir-
vine, as well as the Irvine
Police Department, the Estill
County Sheriff's Department,
the Kentucky State Police
Department, and the citizens
of Irvine and Estill County.;
(3) The murder occured in
Estill*County, not the City of
Irvine. If you had had your in-
Every bit and piece of infor-
mation is passed onto the

Department. All effort is be-
ing made to solve this
murder. We all grieve for the

The Irvine Police Department
has worked a few ‘‘stake
out” as you call it, in an effort to
cut down on thefts. That is
also a part of the officer's job:

Ms. Moore that the officer you
spoke with may not have
known what he was talking
about, or that he may have or
had a personal “‘ax"’ to grind
against someone and possibly

No police department is
perfect and all police depart-_
ments have problems at one
time or another including the
City of Irvine. Currently, ali
but two (2) of Irvine's police
officers have been certified
and trained through the
Department of Training at
‘Eastern Kentucky Unversity.

Department assisted the

other officers have been. It is
not up to one (1) police officer
to set the priorities. The
priority of the Irvine Police
Department is to serve and
anyone else has an idea of

cam better serve our com-
munity-and the people in it,
