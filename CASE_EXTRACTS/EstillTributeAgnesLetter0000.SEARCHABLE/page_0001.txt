Soviet Trade: Detente Revisited?
WASHINGTON - The an-
nouncement last April 11 by White
House chief of staff Donald Regan
of a new Economic Policy Council
to be chaired by Treasury
Secretary James Baker created few
ripples when it was made, but signs
are multiplying that it may be the
vehicle for greatly increased trade
with the Soviet Union and its
allies, and a lessening of national
security oversight of such trade.
The new council replaces a body
called the Senior In-
terdepartmental Group on In-
ternational Economic Policy,
which- previously provided
national security guidance for
overseas trade. While the new
council is ostensibly chaired bythe
president, Baker will run it in
actual fact. The membership will
also include Regan, Vice President
Bush, the secretaries of state,
commerce, agriculture and labor,
the U.S. trade-representative and
the director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
Notably absent are-the secretary
of defense, the national security
saverand the director of the CIA
officials: currently most
concerned with the ‘national
security implications of trade with
the Soviet bloc. Def
Caspar Weinberger raised the roof:
last May when planning for,
Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige's trade journey. to
Moscow on May 20 was originally
placed under the new Economic
Council instead of “the National
Security Council.
Critics claim-that paacgg ta
made plans fr the trip-- to
possibly Startegic oil and gas
equipment sales -- without con-/
sulting the Pentagon. Regan heard
‘Weinberger’s objections aiid at the
last minute shifted the planning
bagk to the NSC. But the original
circumvention does not bode well
for the future.
¢ Reagan administration is
schizophrenic about East Bloc
trade. On the one hand, it is being
Pressured by traditional
Republican constituencies
strongly represented at State,
Commerce and Treasury -- to relax
the reins. On the other, Wein-
berger and the national security
establishment, want to halt the
transfer of militarily useful
tquipment to the Soviet Union.
Reagan has yet to resolve the
oaflict over which is more im-
‘portant.
* BIRD'S BOO-BOO
California’s Chief Justice Rose
Bird already knows she is facing an
uphill fight to win re-election to
the top spot on the highestcourt in
the largest state in the union next
year, but she is risking a loss of
support’ from the party’s im-
portant Jewish constituency by
associating herself publicly: with
one of the nation’s leading anti-
Israeli politicians, former
Republican representative Pete
McCloskey.
Bird's Jewish backers- were
simply. astonished. when Mc-
Closkey, a liberal Republican
whose ardent support for
Palestinian nationalism made him
a target of national Jewish
organizations before his departure
from Congressin 1982 to make an
unsuccessful Senate race, turned
up as a major playerin the Retain
Bird campaign.
Bird did not help her cause any
when she made a speech to a
Jewish group in Los Angeles
focusing on the plight of Japanese-
Americans who| were interned

VIETNAM AND EL
SALVADOR
Amid all the talk last April. of
“reconciliation” with Vietnam 10
years after the end of the war,
there was little mention that
Vietnam, like an evil spirit from
the past, continues to try and
undermine U.S. __ interests,
especially in El Salvador.
According “to the Defense
Department, about 70 percent of
the infantry weapons captured
from communist guerrillas fighting
to overthrow the freely elected
government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte have been traced
to Vietnam. Most of the captured
weapons are U.S,-made M-16 or
AR-15 rifles, the bulk of which
have been traced by their serial
numbers to weapons shipped from
the U.S. to Vietnam and captured.

major accomplishments in his first
term was to get a Reaganite
majority. on the boards and
commissions of — regulatory. *
agencies Congress would not let
him abolish. One of those he has
achieved success with is the
Consumer Product Safety
Commission, which even many
liberals agree had a tendency to be
a. ‘‘national nanny.’’ Now the
agency’s protectors in Congress
want to undo Reaganism by
legislation.
