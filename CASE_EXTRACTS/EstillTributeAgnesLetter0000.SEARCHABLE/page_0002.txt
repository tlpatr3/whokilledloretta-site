Letter To The Editor
Dear Editor
Tam a long-time resident of the
great city of Irvine who is very
troubled by the recent murder of a
15-year-old girl, The person or
persons who committed
this horri-
_ble crime are stillunknown, and are
probably enjoying life right here in
our little community.
What distrubs me so much is
that in a conversation
with one of
our police officers here in Irvine, I
‘was surprised to lear that the
Irvine Police Department
has not
even been briefed on the facts of the
case, and that apparently the
murder
of this unfortunate girl is
rather low on the list of priorities
of
the Mayor (who is a candidate
for ©
re-election,1). and the Chief of
Police.
Tam told that overtime
has been
authorized
for Irvine policemen for
a “stake out” for gasoline and
battery thieves, but that no special
effort at all is being spent on solving
the murder
of this child.
I grieve for the family of this little
girl, and I also grieve for the lack of
concem on the part of the city
officials who will not make every
effort or leave no stone untumed
in
order’
to bring this murderer to
justice,
On behalf of the parents and
grandparents
of young girls, I hope
that this letter will pressure to bear
on the Mayor, the Council and the
Chief of Police of Irvine to
straighten out their priorities and
give. the officers whatever they
need to solve this brutal crime and __
make Irvine safe again.
