Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige’s trade journey to
Moscow on May 20 was originally
placed under the new Economic
Council instead of the National

Critics claim that Baldrige had
made plans for the trip-- to discuss
possibly startegic oil and gas
equipment sales -- without con-
sulting the Pentagon. Regan heard
Weinberger's objections and at the
last minute shifted the planning
back to the NSC. But the original
circumvention does not bode well
for the future.
The Reagan administration is
schizophrenic about East Bloc
trade. On the one hand, it is being
pressured by traditional
Republican constituencies
strongly represented at State,
Commerce and Treasury -- to relax
the reins. On the other, Wein-
berger and the national security
establishment want to halt the
transfer of militarily useful
equipment to the Soviet Union.
Reagan has yet to resolve the
conflict over which is more im-
portant.
BIRD'S BOO-BOO
California’s Chief Justice Rose
Bird already knows she is facing an
uphill fight to win re-election to
the top spot on the highest court in
the largest state in the union next
year, but she is risking a loss of
support from the party’s im-
portant Jewish constituency by
associating herself publicly with
one of the nation’s leading anti-
Isracli politicians, former
Republican representative Pete
McCloskey.
Bird’s Jewish backers were
simply astonished when Mc-
Closkey, a liberal Republican
whose ardent support for
Palestinian nationalism made him
a target of national Jewish
organizations before his departure
from Congress in 1982 to make an
unsuccessful Senate race, turned
up as a major player in the Retain
Bird campaign.
Bird did not help her cause any
when she made a speech to a
Jewish group in Los Angeles
focusing on the plight of Japanese-
Americans who . were interned
during World War I] without
making any mention of the
Holocaust.
California Democrats ‘are
fearful Bird could be clobbered at
the polls next year by as much as
two to one. That could endanger
two other liberal justices up for
reconfirmation, as well as other
candidates on the Democratic
ticket, including Sen. Alan
Cranston.
VIETNAM AND EL

Vietnam, like an evil spirit from
the past, continues to try and
undermine U.S, _ interests,
especially in El Salvador.
According to the Defense
Department, about 70 percent of
the infantry weapons captured
from communist guerrillas fighting
to overthrow the freely elected
government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte have been traced
to Vietnam. Most of the captured
weapons are U.S.-made M-16 or

A Poison Ivy F
By Paul G. Donohue, M.D.
“Dear Dr. Donohue: What's the
best way to treat poison ivy? —
5.D.""
Let’s speak of prevention first.
You have to be able to recognize
poison ivy and its ilk. You can find
pictures in encyclopedias.
Remember the old adage: ‘Leaves
ofthree, let it be."”
Upon contact with a known
culprit, wash the area within 15
minutes. If you don’t, you'll get
the rash. Use plain water. Soap
facilitates spread of the oily resin
}gof the plant leaves.

Sth District Congressman
Three years ago, one of my top
priorities in Congress was to
become a member
of the powerful
House Appropriations Commit-
tee. The reason was simple; here
was a place whereI could directly
help our Fifth District on any
number of issues. Fortunately,
the
House leadership saw fit to place
me on this choice committee.
The opportunity to help our
district was clearly demonstrated
this past week, as the House began
acting on the 1986 appropriations
We also approved funding for
the Big South Fork National River
and Recreation Area,
a burgeoning
tourist area. Earlier this year, of
course, we got work restarted on
the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, and
have now moved funding for next
year through the full committee.

What if you can’t get the resin
off in time? You should get the
stuff off your skin anyway, for
you can spread the rash to other
parts of your body (and to others)
by contact. Same goes for pet fur
and clothing. The resin can be
spread that way as well.
Here's what happens next. From
five to 21 days after exposure the
skin turns red and itches. If it's a
repeat exposure this can happen as
soon as a day or two after. Directly
following the redness and itch
come the blisters. Their fluid is
harmless and won't cause poison

First, you're stuck with trying to
make yourself as comfortable as
possible. It’s going to take one to
three weeks for everything to
subside depending on how much
oil got on your skin.
You can relieve the itch with
drying lotions, calamine or
Burow’s solution (a pharmacist
can help you formulate the latter).
When weeping (of the blisters, of
course) has subsided you can begin
steroid creams; the kind available
over-the-counter will do. If you
have a first-rate case, the doctor
might want to prescribe oral
steroids to quiet the inflammation.
