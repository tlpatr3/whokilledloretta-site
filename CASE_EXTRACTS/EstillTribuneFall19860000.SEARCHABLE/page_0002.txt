Grand jury indicts 3
by DELORES PATRICK
Estill County Tribune
The EStill County Grand Jury
handed down three indictments last
Friday.
‘Indicted were Jimmy Adams,
Danny McCoy and Mickey Reed.
Adams and McCoy were indicted
for the early August burglary of the
Broadway Grocery. Reed was indic-
ted for the February 10, 1985
murder
of Loretta Lynn Willoughby.
Willoughby was fifteen years old
when she disappeared in February,
1985.
~ She was reported missing, but her
body was not discovered until three
months later in a wooded area off
Broadway.
Her badly decomposed body was
‘discovered’ by Reed who reported it
to the Irvine Police Department.
Articles of clothing found at the
scene were partially used to identify
her body.
Reed had been a suspect in the
case for quite sometime, and was
reported to have refused
to take a lie-
detector test. However, early in the
summer Reed stated that he had
taken and passed the lie-detector
test.
The Willoughby murder has been
* one of the more highly publicized
unsolved murders in recent years,
apparently because
of her youth. She
was also the mother of a young
‘son.
Several other murders have been
committed in the country during the
past“ five years which remain
unsolved. However, most of them
seem to have been forgotten.
Reed's bond was set at $50,000
cash or property. He was arrested by
Sheriff Glendle Flynn on Friday
shortly after the indictment was
handed down.
