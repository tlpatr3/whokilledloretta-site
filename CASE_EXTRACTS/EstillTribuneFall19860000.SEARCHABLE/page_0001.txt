Walker trial goes
to the jury
by DELORES PATRICK
Estill County Tribune
The jury was scheduled to begin
deliberating
on a verdict in the Bob
‘Walker murder trial yesterday.
However,
at9 p.m. Judge James
Chenault met in a closed session
with the defendant Nick Harrison
and the attorneys.
At that time Harrison apparen- ~
tly complained that he was suffer-
ing from stomach pains.
Chenault then ordered that
Harrison be sent to the Pattie A.
(Clay Hospital for an examination,
and the jury was recessed until the
results were known.
A verdict in a trial is not usually
given unless the defendant is
present, and that was the reason for
the delay in the trial.
The trial began Monday, Septem-
ber 22, but it took two days to find a
jury of fourteen people since the
prosecution was seeking the death
penalty.
The fourteen memberjury, includ»
ing two alternates, was made up of to the Estill County Grand Jury.

A meeting of the Estill County
Fiscal Court on Monday: morning
ended with no action taken on the
issue of payroll tax, and the Depart-
ment of Local Government taking
over control of county expend-
itures,
In what Judge McClanahan had
earlier called “the most important
meeting ever”, there was clearly
two different opinions to the issue of
a payroll tax.
Judge McClanahan opened the
meeting by readinga letter from the
Department of Local Goverment.
Following is an edited version of
that letter:
On Wednesday, the Common-
wealth began calling their first
witnesses, and called a total of 36
during four days of testimony.
The trial was expected to last two
weeks, but was cut short when the
defense decided not to call any
witnesses. Attomeys
Max M. Smith»
of Frankfort and J. Campbell
Cantrill III of Georgetown decided\,
not to call any witnesses: after the
defendant refused to testify. ,
Qne witness, Hubert Chaney, was
subpoenaed by both the defense and
the prosecution, but was never called
to take the stand.
Throughout the trial Smith
insinuated there were other people
who could have murdered Bob
Walker. Police officers investigating
the case were often made to feet
imcompetent by Smith.
Smith also questioned the
credibility of some of the witnesses,
especially since three admitted they
had been convicted of felonies.
He also began pointing out that
some of the witnesses’ testimony.

Assistant attomey general Barbara
M. Whaley, assisted by Common-
wealth’s attomey Thomas J. Smith
III, established a motive for the
murder by introducing testimony
from the July 7, 1985 shooting of
Bob Walker and Harrison. during a
shootout at Harrisoh’s home.
Witnesses testified that Harrison
showed off his scars resulting from

Some of the witnesses stated that
after the shooting Harrison had told
them he had killed Bob Walker.
‘Thetrailer park residents described
a small white car and the crime lab
experts indicated that Harrison's car
had come n contact with the police
cruiser on the day of the murder.
A photo of Harrison with a
handgun in his belt was also submit-
ted as evidence. The prosecution
gave the opinion that the handgun
was the murder weapon although it
was never found.
On Monday, the last day of
testimony, many delays were made
for Harrison to decide if he would
testify against himself.
He also asked fora continuance in
the trial ‘because his attomeys had
not been getting along and commun-
icating with each other. However,
his request was denied.
Throughout the trial Max M.

record,

Al Howell, Local Government
Advisor Chief was on hand to
explain the options to members of
the fiscal court, and summed upthe
letter by saying “If you don’t take
action today—we will take action to
cut out all spending—we have an
order to that effect.”
Howell reminded the members
of
the fiscal court that when they had
been been sworn in to their office,
they agreed
to obey all of the laws of
the state of Kentucky, and that one
of the laws is that you can’t spend
more than you take in. He also
explained that his department could
not allow the problem to go any
longer, because it would be worse
next year than it is now.
Howell repeated “Unless you
come with some kind of plan to raise
revenue, we have to issue this order,
I already have this order signed
and ready.”
Magistrate Mark Honchell
questioned Mr. Howell, “I asked
this question in Frankfort, but

Grandjury indicts 3
by DELORES PATRICK
Estill County Tribune
The Estill County Grand Jury
handed down three indictments last
Friday.
Indicted were Jimmy Adams,
“Danny McCoy and Mickey Reed.
Adams and McCoy were indicted
for the early August burglary of the
Broadway Grocery. Reed was indic-
ted for the February 10, 1985
murder of Loretta Lynn Willoughby.
Willoughby was fifteen years old
when she disappearedin February,
1985.
« She was reported missing, but her
body was not discovered until three
months later in a wooded area off
Broadway.
Her badly decomposed body was
‘discovered’ by Reed who reported it
to the Irvine Police Department.
Articles of clothing found at the
scene were partially used to identify
her body.
Reed had been a suspect in the
case for quite sometime, and was
reported to have refused
to take a lie-
detector test. However, early in the
summer Reed stated that he had
taken and passed the lie-detector
test,
The Willoughby murder has been
* one of the more highly publicized
unsolved murders in recent years,
apparently because
of her youth. She
was also the mother of a young
‘son,
‘Several other murders have been
committed in the country during the
past five years which remain
unsolved. However, most of them
seem to have been forgotten.
Reed's bond was set at $50,000
cash or property. He was arrested by
Sheriff Glendle Flynn on Friday
shortly after the indictment was
handed down.
