Estill County Tribune
Micky Reed was released
on bond
Friday afternoon following a bond
hearing with Circuit Judge Edward
Jackson.
Reed has been charged with the
February 10, 1986 murder of
Loretta Lynn Willoughby.
He has been in jail on that charge
since he was indicted on Sept. 26.
His bond had been set at $50,000
property
or cash and he had not been
able t raise that amount.
Jackson allowed Reed's mother,
Bessie McIntosh, anda friend tosign
surety bonds for Reed’s release. The
two owned properties valued at
$9,500, but the court was told the
properties were actually worth more
than they were evaluated for.
A trial date for Reed was then set
for Monday, January 12.
The attomey for Charles Todd
also requested that a bond be set for
hisclient. ~
Todd was accused of murdering
his aunt in Lee County, but was tried
‘and found guilty in Estill County on
a change of venue. ‘Recently, the
Supreme Court of Kentucky granted
Todd a new trial.

asked that bond be denied to Todd.
Apparently, the Commonwealth's
decision was made because of
Todd's history of behavior.

a decision on Todd's bond until
Tuesday, and that outcome was not
available at press time.

set for James Frymyer and Vicky L.
Rose after Frymyer's attorney,
Thomas J. Hollon, requested bail be
set for his client.
Frymyer and Rose have been
“ charged with second degree burglary
of the Herbert Harrison residence on
January 31, 1986. A trial date was
originally scheduled for the couple
in
July onthe same day
as another trial.
Before Frymyer’s trial began, he
became “nervous” and left the
courtroom.
Frymyer has been incarcerated in
the Estill County Jail for about three
weeks since he was picked up on a
bench warrant for leaving the court
room in July. ¢
Prior to the July trial date, Rose
had made bond, and Frymyer was
apparently released on his own
recognizance.
However, on Friday Judge
Jackson refused to release Frymyer
on his own recognizance. From all
indications, Frymyer is not able to
make the batid which has been set.
