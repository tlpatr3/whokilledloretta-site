Murdercharge
against Reed
dismissed Friday
The case against Mickey
Reed, accused murderer of
Loretta Lynn Willoughby, was
thrown out of court last Friday
due to lack of enough evidence
to sustain a conviction.
According to Reed’s attor-
ney, William Chambliss, the
order dismissing the case cited
that the Commonwealth did
not have proof to sustain a
conviction of Reed and
questioned whether a crime
was committed at all.
“The evidence gathered said
that Willoughby was killed by
a blow to the head, but it

The dismissal comes after
an 18-month grand jury inves-
tigation into Willoughby’s
death, and a trial date for
Reed had been set for May 15.
Missing for three months,
Willoughby’s body was found
in a wooded area behind Irvine
on May 10,1985 by Reed. She
was 15.
A coroner's report said that
Willoughby’s death was a
homicide.
The commonwealth is still
able to continue investigating
the case and return it to the
grand jury again if more in-
formation surfaces, but Assis-
tant Commonwealth Attorney
Phillip Owens said he doubts
the investigation will continue
unless something new shows
up.
Owens said the grand jury,
which does not determine
guilt, did a thorough job in its
investigation and felt there
was enough evidence to make
a charge; but as the trial drew
closer, the evidence wasn't
enough to convict Reed.
“I could prove she was dead,
‘I could prove how she died, but.
~I couldn't place. her with
anyone...it_ was too remote,”
Owens said. “The judge asked
me...I told him what evidence I
had and he said, That’s not
much, is it?”
Owens said that there
wasn't a statute of limitations
on a felony case in Kentucky
«so the case would not be
* closed.
“We never close a case,” he
said.
