Indictments issued
Five people have been indic-
ted by the Estill County grand
jury, but the indictments were
not signed by a judge and no
bail was set as of Monday.
The grand jury handed
down a two-count indictment
against Steve Reed, Montie
Steelman and Charles Jim
Brooks for third - degree
burglary and theft.
The three men allegedly en-
tered Cedar Village Res-
taurant on Sept. 17, 1986 and
stole a cash register.
A two count indictment was
also handed down for Jerry
Stone.
The indictment says that
Stone committed the offense of
second-degree burglary by en-
tering the dwelling of Ronnie
Lee Tipton with the intent to
commit a crime.
Count two says that Stone
committed the offense of
receiving stolen _ property
valued at $100 or more.
Claude Jamison Jr. was in-
dicted for the offense of theft.
The indictment says that
Jamison took two carburators -
last September belonging to
Tony Flynn. 2
The grand jury does not
determine the guilt or in-
nocence of a person; it merely
looks at the evidence ofa case
and determines if it warrants
a trial.
