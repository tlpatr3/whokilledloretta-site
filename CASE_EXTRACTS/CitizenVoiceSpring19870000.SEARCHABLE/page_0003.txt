$200,000
Health department seeking 3,000 square foot
expansion through matching grant with state
By JOHN A, NELSON
Citlsen Voice& Times Editor
The Estill County Health
Department is seeking a
$100,000 grant from the Ken-
tucky Cabinet for Human
Resources to add 3,000 square
feet of space to its facility on
River Drive. The project is ex-
pected to cost $200,000.
The other $100,000 will be
provided locally, with about
$76,000 coming from capital
outlay monies currently in the
health department's budget.
The remainder will be taken
from monies accumulated from
the health department’s taxing
district.
According to Estill County
Judge-Executive Ralph Mc-
Clanahan, who is also
chairman of the health
department board of directors,
an oral commitment to fund
the construction was received
last week from Human
Resources Secretary Al Austin
during a visit here.
Austin requested a letter
from county officials outlining
the program and the funds
needed and agreeing to the lo-
cal match, McClanahan said.
The 3,000 square foot addi-
tion is'said to be needed for en-
largement of the waiting room,
three new clinic rooms, four
new offices, two -restrooms
designed for the handicapped,
a small lab, a record unit, a
storage and supplies room,
and a‘conference room which
can be used for educational
purposes.
Repairs to the existing
building are also being con-
sidered, along with paving of

Fiscal Court gives nod
to health dept. project
By BOB HERRON
Citizen Voice & Times Stall Writer
Three members of the fiscal
court signed a letter Tuesday
supporting the health depart-
ment’s attempts to-receive a
grant which would be used for
a $200,000 expansion.
The $100,000 matching
grant, which has been sought
by the health board since last
September, would come from
the state and would be used to
provide more room for patients
served at the health depart-
ment.
The letter to E. Austin,
secretary of the Cabinet for
Human Resources, expresses
the court's agreement to the

A guilty plea on a charge of -
expansion and outlines what
the grant money would go
toward.
Besides the addition of
rooms, the grant would also be
used to build two restrooms
designed for the handicapped,
one small lab, repairs to the
existing building and blacktop
for the parking lot.
The letter expresses the
hope that construction could
begin in June.
Newly appointed ad-
ministrator to the health
department Fern Dalton said
the health board would match
the funds from the state with
money it has earmarked in

the parking lot.
The .current facility was
builtin 4961. Itycontains nine
rooms and three rest rooms
with no handicapped facilities
in the 1633 square feet of*
space.
In the 25 years the facility
has been open, the staffing has
more than doubled. In 1962,
the health department had
three full-time employees and
. one part time. Today there are
eight and five, respectively.
During the last fiscal year,
ere were 19,835. services
provided to 4,553 “un-
duplicated” patients, according
to a letter front McClanahan to
Austin last September.
The letter cited conditions
so crowded that as many as
three employees providing
counseling to patients are
sharing the same office, and it
told of instancesin which ser-
vices are being providedin the
hallway and waiting rooms.
Some patients have repor-
tedly had to wait in the park-
ing lot.
Some staff and services are

The initial’ request from
" McClanahan, in the Septem-
ber letter, asked for only 800
Additional square feet of floor
space, consisting of five clinic
and examining rooms. It of-
fered $50,000 in local match-
ing funds for an equal amount
of state-funds.
When it was discovered that
the state might be willing to
provide as much as $100,000,
the request was scaled up to
include the additional office
space and the paving of the
parking lot.
The Estill County Fiscal
Court sent a letter to Austin
Tuesday expressing support
for the project and further out-
lining the specific needs.
Representatives of an en-
gineering firm were in Irvine
Monday to review the facility
and discuss the development
of plans.
The court’s letter tells
Austin that construction could
begin in early to mid June.

Murder charge
against Reed
dismissed Friday.
The case against Mickey
Reed, accused murderer of
Loretta Lynn Willoughby, was
thrown out of court last Friday
due to lack of enough evidence
to sustain a conviction.
According to Reed’s attor-
ney, William Chambliss, the
order dismissing the case cited
that the Commonwealth did
not have proof to sustain a
conviction of Reed and
questioned whether a crime
was committed at all.
“The evidence gathered said
that Willoughby was killed by
a blow to the head, but it
didn’t rule out an accident,”
Chambliss said. “It certainly
didn’t connect Mickey Reed to
ite
The dismissal comes after
an 18-month grandjury inves-
tigation into Willoughby’s
death, and a trial date for
Reed had been set for May 15.
Missing for three months,
Willoughby’s body was found
in a wooded area behind Irvine
on May 10,1985 by Reed. She
was 15.
A coroner's report said that
Willoughby’s death was a
homicide.
The ‘commonwealth is still
able to continue investigating
the case and return it to the
grand jury again if more in-
formation surfaces, but Assis-
tant Commonwealth Attorney
Phillip Owens said he doubts
the investigation will continue
unless something new shows
up.
Owens said the grand jury,
which does not determine
guilt, did a thorough job in its
investigation and felt there
was enough evidence to make
a charge; but as the trial drew
closer, the evidence wasn't
enough to convict Reed.
“I could prove she was dead,
I could prove how she died, but
I couldn't place. her with
anyone...it was too remote,”
Owens said. “The judge asked
me...I told him what evidence I
had and he said, That’s not
much, is it?”
Owens said that there
wasn’t a statute of limitations
on a felony case in Kentucky
«so the case would not be
closed.
“We never close a case,” he
said.
