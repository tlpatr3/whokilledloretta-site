Skeletal Remains
Still Unidentified |
by DEBBIE POWELL
ESTILL COUNTY TRIBUNE
The skeletal remains ofa young,
white female found about one half
mile off Broadway are still uniden-
tified, according to Estill County
Sheriff Montie Parks.
At 9:12 a.m., Friday night the
Irvine Police Department reported
the discovery of skeletal remains to
our office, said a Kentucky State
Police spokesman.
Bob Walker, Estill County
deputy sheriff, said an unamed
subject was walking through the
woods behind Winn's garage on
Boradway when he found a pair of
shoes, without laces and sitting
side-by-side by a tree. The subject
then noticed a peculiar odor and
reportedly saw another article of
clothing laying in a drain.
The subject left the scene and
retumed with three other men who
found the piece of clothing
to be a
pair of jeans which encased the
pelvic boen ofa female. Jaw bones
and a white jacket were found near
the jeans. The shoe laces were also
found here.
Retumjng to the-Irvine Police
Department, the group alerted the
sheriffs department and the
Kentucky State Police.
Several rescue squad members,
police officers, member of the
sheriff's department and volunteers
retumed to the densely wooded
rarely travelled area.
Upto the right of where the jeans
were found, a torso was discovered.
About 100 yards
down the drain an
arm and the remainder of the skull
was found.
Although several other bones
were found in the area, some bones
were not found,
A forensic pathologist from
Lexington took the bones and will
make a model of what the female
would have looked like according
to the structure of the bones.
‘Walker said the model may be
complete in two or three days or
Boundaries of City
To Be Determined

ESTILL COUNTY TRIBUNE
“Nobody knows” where the city
boundaries are, said Councilman
two or three weeks, according to
the work the state pathologist has.
He said the many fox, dog and
other animal tracks lead the inves-
tigators to believe that the body
was tom apart and cleaned by the
animals.
Sheriff Montie Parks said that
although no identification could be
made until the model is ready, the
clothing remains on the body
indicate the skeleton may be that
of
a local teenager who has been
missing for about three months.
Walker said if the body is that
of
the missing female the body could
have been frozen and preserved
during the winter storms.
Much information is being
withheld pending completion ofthe +
model and the investigation.
until after a lengthy investigation
by the council as to where the
boundaries are.
Davis said he did not feel that
