‘Murder charge is dropped
in Loretta Willoughby case
by DELORES PATRICK
Estill County Tribune
An indictment’ against. Mickey
Reed for the February 10, 1985
murder of Loretta Lynn Willoughby.
has been dismissed in Estill Circuit
Court.
Circuit Judge Edward Jackson
tuled for the dismissal late Frida’
afternoon, but it will not be offcitt
until he signs the typed orders later
this week.
Reed was scheduled to go on trial
on the murder charge on May 13.
But on March 24. Reed's attor-
ney, William Chambliss. filed a
motion for the dismissal based upon
four reasons. with the first being a
lack of efidence.
Secondly. Chambliss asked that
the indictmefit be dismissed because
several of the “witnesses who
appeared before the grand jury had a
motivation to fabricate their testimony.
Those witnesSes have since been
indicted on felony charges which
questions their credibility as wit-
nesses.
Thirdly. Chambliss stated that
Reed had submitted himself to a
polygraph test given by the
Kentucky State Police which
revealed that he had no knowledge
of
the murder, However. Chambliss
Stated that the grand jury was inade-
quately informed on this matter.
Last of all. certain scientific tests
were made of the defendant's hair
and body fluids. but they did not
match up with evidence found at the
scene ofthe crime. Chambliss stated
that this excluded Reed from the
range of possible suspects.
During a_ coriversation with
Chambliss Friday. he stated that
dismissing the charges against Reed
would allow for reopening the inves-
tigation. He also stated that three or
four other individuals had appeared
before the grand jury who were as
likely to have been suspects as
Reed was.
Willoughby’s body was found in
ina wooded area behind
vay. Her body was discovered
by Reed. which made him the
number one suspect for over a
year.
For over a year, Reed refused to
take the polygraph test given by the
Kentucky State Police. However, he
did agree to the test and passed it
several months prior to the grand
jury's indictment on September 24.
1986.
Willoughby. who was only 15
years old at the time, is thought to
have died from a blow to the side of
her head. Also, there was other
evidence of foul play at the scene of
the crime which indicated. murder
rather than death from natural
causes.
She was also believed to have
been sexually molested. which has
limited the suspects to males.
Dismissing the indictment against
Reed does not mean that he cannot
be indicted again in the future on the
same charge if more evidence
appears which implicates him.
However. if the case had gone to
court and he had been found not-
guilty. then he could not have been
retried if new evidence appeared.
~ Chambliss had filed a motion for
dismissal on March 24 which gave
Prosecutor Phillip Owens until Apri!
10 to produce witnesses and reasons
why the indictment should not be
dismissed.
However, on Friday, Owens had
No witnesses present at court.
Owens stated that the judge would
have ruled for a directed verdict
when he gave his opening remarks in
this case.
The prosecutor
also said that none
of the present evidence places Reed
near Willoughby at any time when
the murder occurred.
Another reason given for dismiss-
ingthe charge before Reed was tried.
is to save the expense of a jury trial
when there was not enough evidente
for a conviction.
Because Reed “hung around”
with law. enforcement officials.
many have been accused of covering
up for him. until the grand jury indic
ted him.
After Reed was indicted. he spent
about a month in the Estill County
Jail before he was able to post the
$50,000 property or cash bond
which had been set for him.
