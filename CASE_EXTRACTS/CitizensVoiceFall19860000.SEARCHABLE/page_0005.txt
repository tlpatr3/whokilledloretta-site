The Irvine City Council, in a
regular meeting Monday,
voted to pay the insurance
premiums for its vehicles for
six months.
However, Mayor David
Shéarer said Tuesday that due
to a billing error ap-
proximately $7,000 will be
knocked off the figure that he
told council was due at Mon-
day's meeting.
At the meeting, Shearer
said the insurance premium
for one year will cost the city
approximately $17,000, and
council opted to pay a six-
month premium with the hope
of having. something te work
with until the premium comes
due again in April.
City Attorney Phillip Owens
said a vote was not needed on
the payment, but Shearer re-
quested one anyway.
After talking with Butch
Birchfield of Big E Insurance,
Shearer said there was a mis-
take in the billing and the city
owes approximately $7,000
less than originally said.
“I believe that if council had
known about this last night,
then they would have voted to
pay for the full year,” Shearer
said Tuesday.
Councilman Bill Singleton
voted to pay the six month
premium rather than the full
year's with the hope the city
would reduce its premium
within the six months.
“I would be in favor of
paying for six months,” said
Singleton. “Let's pay it for six
months and try to get rid of
some of this stuff(vehicles) in
the meantime.”
Councilman Tom: Williams
agreed. \
“We have a lot of vehicles
for a one-horse town,” Wik
liams said. ee
_ Owens spoke to the éouncil
on suing for back taxes and
the importance of having a
planning and zoning commis-
sion. :
Owens said that if a com-
plaint is brought to court to
collect back taxes, it would be
along the’ lines,of the City of
Irvine versus 19tracts
of land.
“I spoke with a county at-
torney, who had been county:
attorney for about 30 years,
and asked him why they never
did sue, for back taxes this
way. He told me it was the
‘shear logistics of it,” Owens
said. “It would take about
three months to get the paper
work done, and then what they
recovered wouldn't cover the
‘cost of typing paper.”
Owens said if the city
decided to sue for back taxes,
he will file against 15 to 30
tracts of land.
“Hopefully, that would bring
in some “we ‘wouldn’t have to
take to court,” Owens said.
As to the planning and
zoning commission, Owens
said the city needed to have
the commission active.
“You've already got the sys-
, tem set-up,” Owens said. “You
just don’t have the warm
bodies to do it with.”
*, Singleton asked, if a com-
mission became active, how
the rules. and_ regulations
would be enforced.
Owens said there are penal-
ties provided.
“The idea is you let people
know exactly what it(the
penalty) is,” Owens said. “You
have a man going into a build-
ing for business, and you've
got to have someone he can go
to and ask what the CRty of Ir-
vine requires. He is owed that
much.”
In other business:
Williams mentioned the
possibility of council going into
“executive session, but Shearer
said he knew what the subject
of such a session would be.

which allowed Reed’s mother,
Bessie McIntosh, and a friend,
Clarence Estes, to put up ap-
proximately $10,000 in
property to cover the original
$50,000 property bond set.
Circuit Court Judge Ed
Jackson said he would not
lower the bond, but did allow
the property to act as surety
for Reed's court appearance:

Reed is still covered by the
original bond, but the property
put up should suffice to insure
that Reed does not try to leave.
“Both his mothér and a good
friend stand to lose their
homes if he leaves,” Owens
said.
Reed was indicted for the
murder on Sept. 26.
Willoughby, who was 15 at
the time of her murder, is the
daughter of Larry and Mollie
Willoughby and a native of
Powell County. She was last
seen Feb. 10, 1985.
Her remains were found
May 10, 1985 by Reed in a
