Micky Reed, 27, the accused
murderer of Loretta Lynn Wil-
loughby, is free on bond, fol-
lowing a hearing last Friday.
which allowed Reed’s mother,
Bessie McIntosh, and a friend,
Clarence Estes, to put up ap-
proximately $10,000 in
property to cover the original
$50,000 property bond set.
Circuit Court Judge Ed
Jackson said he would not
lower the bond, but did allow
the property to act as surety
for Reed’s court appearance:
Assistant | Commonwealth
Attorney Phillip Owens’ said
Reed is still covered by the
original bond, but the property
put up should suffice to insure
that Reed does not try to leave.
“Both his mothér and a good
friend stand to lose their
homes if he leaves,” Owens
said. z
Reed was indicted for the
murder on Sept. 26.
Willoughby, who was 15 at
the time of her murder, is the
daughter of Larry and Mollie
Willoughby and a native of
Powell County. She was last
seen Feb. 10, 1985.
Her remains were found
May 10, 1985 by Reed in a
wooded area near Broadway in
Irvine.
“Reed reported at the time of
Willoughby’s discovery that he
was roaming the woods when
he came upon a pair of shoes,
noticed a strong odor and went
for help. bi
Later, the remains of the
girl and several articles of.
clothing were found in thé
vicinity.
