Wallace Wilkinson believes
that new federal tax reforms
will result in a “windfall” of
money for the state of Ken-
tucky, and he thinks that
money should be used to
replace the loss of revenue
sharing dollars now being suf-
fered in many rural com-
munities.
He gave that assessment
last weekend when asked if he
would favor a broader range of
taxing powers for fiscal courts,
which are now limited to
property and _ occupational
taxes.
Estill County's fiscal court
has refused several times to
pass an occupational (payroll)
tax, saying it is unfair. The
state now has control of the
county’s finances.
Wilkinson, a gubernatorial
hopeful for 1987, was quick to
answer. “Ido not gupport any-
thing which would precipitate
new taxes,” he said.
He explained that the
“windfall” of money would be
the result of a decrease in the
federal income tax. Kentucky's
tax rate will remain the same,
but the increase in net income
to individuals due to the
federal change is expected to
bring more dollars to the
state’s coffers.
Wilkinson was here. last
Saturday for a campaign rally
at the Estill County Fair Barn.
The local Democratic Party,
at the hands of County
Coordinator Margaret Barnes,
organized a pig roast complete
with live entertainment, free
to all comers, which lasted
from 6:30 until midnight.
Everything was paid for by the
Wilkinson for Governor Com-
mittee.
Wilkinson, a wealthy and
well-known Lexington
developer, arrived at around 8
p.m. in his private helicopter.
In typical campaign style,
he delivered a speech predict-

ing a “new day in Kentucky,”
and saying “the best is yet to
come.”
He downplayed his current
wealth by reminding those
present that he comes from
rural asey County and
“bootstrapped” his way into
success. He said that at one
time he had gone to “every
bank in Kentucky to get a
$3,000 loan,” but was unsuc-
cessful.
Wilkinson called for.a new
approach to economic
development in rural Ken-
tucky.. “We're going to stop
looking for one big deal,” he L

limits
The Estill County Board of
Education may have to ter-
minate school bus routes
which include several newly-
inspected bridges that are
rated for well below the weight
limit required for such traffic.
Superintendent William
Alexander received correspon-
dence last month from Charles
Lambert, the chief engineer of
District 10 of the state high-
way department in Jackson,
informing him of the results of
an annual bridge inspection.
The letter noted that inspec-
tions are required annually on
bridges with a clear span of at
least 20 feet. The results of the
inspection are forwarded to
county judge-executives.
In August, the Department
of Education requested that
the information also be
provided to local school dis-
tricts.
As a result, a controversy
arose in Breathitt County, the
home of the highway
department's District 10, when
the school board there was for-
ced to have buses unload
before crossing several
bridges, and reload students
on the other side.
Money was not available to
make the necessary repairs to
the bridges.
According to Alexander, the
solution in Breathitt will not
work in Estill, since the
bridges. in question do not
meet the weight limit re-
aulieements even for an empty

“The court is under the
