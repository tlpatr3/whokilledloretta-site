By BOB HERRON
Citizen Voice & Times Stall Writer
The wheels of justice froze
to a standstill last Monday, as
Circuit Court, Judge Edward
Jackson rescheduled a murder
trial- of the lack of
heat in the courtroom.
“The trial of Clifton Earl
Hunt was rescheduled for Dec.
1: beeati€ Watson found the:
courtroom, too cold for the
- jury’s comfort.
Hunt has been indicted for
murder and assault in the
dune 1 death of James A. Neal
on Pea Ridge.
Until heat is restored to the
“courthouse, court will be held
at the National Guard Armory
in Ravenna.
“The courthouse? has been
without heat sirice Oct. 15,

boiler burst, ‘but County
Judge-Executive Ralph Mc-

By BOB HERRON
Citieen Voloe & Times Stall Writer
A lawsuit seeking payment
of damages has been filed by
the parents of Gary Shawn
Gregory against Isaacs Lum-
ber Company, Bobby Isaacs
and Earl Young.
Gregory is the Hargett
Elementary student who was
struck and killed by a truck on
Aug. 21 while exiting a school
bus less than a half mile from
Irvine on Kentucky Highway
89.
He was nine years old.
The truck was owned by the
Isaacs Lumber Company and
was being driven by Earl
Young, 49.
The eight count lawsuit al-
leges ~ that arl Young
operated the truck in “a
negligent, reckless or wanton
manner so as to cause it (the
Victoria Faye Spencer
truck) to strike and kill...”
regory. «
The lawsuit also claims that
the defendants (Young, Isaacs
and Isaacs Lumber Company)
“..should have known that the
1976 Chevrolet truck...was
defective in that the truck's
brake system was inoperative
or failing and they knowingly
placed said vehicle on the
roads of this Commonwealth
in such a defective condition
and such acts were willful and
wanton...” -
Gregory's parents, Dorothy
and Gary, are asking for: com-
pensatory: damages for the es-
tate of the decendant in an
amount in excess of $2,500;
damages for the loss of com-
panionship of their decendant,
in an amount excess of $2,500;
funeral expenses in the sum of
$15,000; punitive damages in
a sum in excess of $2,500 and
A 15-year-old Estill County
High School student has been
reported missing.
Victoria Faye “Vicki” Spen-
cer“was last seen at the high
school on Oct. 31, according to
Irvine Police Officer Dan Fer-
son,
“She is being handled as a
runaway at this time,” Fer-
guson said.
Spencer is 5 feet 7 inches
tall, 125 pounds and has
shoulder length brown hair,
all other relief to which they
and the estate are entitled.
The Gregorys are also as-
king for a trial by jury.
According to the report filed
by Kentucky State Police
Trooper Phillip Becknell, the~
vehicle’s brakes failed to stop
the truck, so Young swerved to
the left to miss the bus and
then struck Gregory.
Gregory was pronounced
dead on arrival at Marcum-
Wallace Memorial Hospital
from massive internal injuries.
Young was subsequently
charged with reckless
homicide and lodged in the Es-
till County Jail. He was
released on the same day on
$2,500 cash bond. The charge
is still pending, according to
the Estill circuit clerk's office.
The death was reportedly
the first school bus related
fatality in Estill County.

children in school.”
Williams has a daughter
who is a junior at Estill
County High School. In the
September interview he made
note of that and said, “I
thought I'd run one more
time.”
The only other school board
race this year was in District
5, consisting of the Red Lick
and West Irvine precincts,
where incumbent Wayne
Gentry faced two unsuccessful
challengers in Donald Wayne
Richardson and Greg Wright.
Gentry retained his seat on
the board, which he has held
for 17¢yéimm and which was
held by this father before him,
by only votes over

Gentry carried both
precingts.
Wrightefinished third, only
38 votes behind Richardson. It
was Wright's first bid for the
office, Richardson’s second.
In statewide and regional
elections, U.S. Representative
Harold Rogers, State Senator
John “Eck” Rose and State
Representative Clarence
Noland Jr. ran unopposed on
the ballot to retain their seats.
RW. Dyche III was also unop-
posed for a spot as a judge on
peals.
Joe Lambert soundly
defeated Charles A. Luker in
Estill County voting for a
Supreme Court Justice in the
3rd Supreme Court District,

Democratic Sen. Wendell
Ford also carried Estill County
soundly, ‘beating Republican
Jackson M. Andrews 1,424 to
690.
The two proposed constitu-
tional amendments did not
fare well with local voters.
Amendment #1, the proposal
to make the state superinten-
dent of public instruction an
appointed rather than elected
position, was beaten here by
more than a 2 to 1 margin,
1,022
tp 465.
Amendment #2 was not as
strongly opposed here, but was
defeated, nonetheless. That
amendment called for a provi-
sion allowing mayors of first
class cities to sUcceed them-
selves.
County Court Clerk Dora
Henry called Tuesday's tur-
nout “fair.” She said the school
board races brought more
people to the polls. “If we'd had
a school board race in every
precinct;;we would have had a
better turnout,” she said.

Tuesday’s election w
made legal by an appointme

said, which provided t
county with three comm

four-member board.
Appointed to fill one oft
spots was Democrat Herm
Harrison, who said Tuesd
night that the lack of liabil
insurance did not worry him
“I'm not going to do ar
thing wrong, anyway,” he sa
“I told them (the other co
missioners) that if they cov
all go to jail, I could, too.”
Harrison said he was
concerned because the boa
had never had_ insurar
before and that has yet
cause problems for comm
sioners.
It is the duty of the cour
board of elections to cert

Emest “Ghock * Muncie and Amanda Francis Mortis were killed when fire engulfed this tr
on Hood Avenue Sunday night. Investigators say the two were probably overcome by fur
from a couch which was set afire by asmoidering cigarette.
~ Trailer fire kills Irvine couple
By BOB HERRON
Citlsen Volce & Times Staff Writer
Preliminary investigations
show that the fire which
caused two people's deaths and
burned a trailer in the trailer
park on Hood Avenue Sunday,
could have been started by a
cigarette, according to State
Police Arson Investigator Mike
Leonard.
Leonard said that his inves-
tigation didn’t turn up any
evidence that electrical wiring
or a gas stove in the trailer
had anything to do with the
re.
The two who were found
dead in the trailer have been
identified as Ernest “Chock”
Muncie, 73, and Amanda
Frances Morris56, Som.
‘county Coroner Wafren
Toler said that his preliminary
findings show the couple died
from smoke inhalation, but
that conclusion will not be
made final until after an
autopsy is performed in Louis-
ville.
Speculation was raised that
foul play may have’been invol-
ved because Morris was lying
_ on the couch and Muncie was
sitting in a chair-next to the
door, but Leonard said that in
all probability a cigarette had
fallen onto the couch.
Leonard said that the
couple's proximity to the door
had nothing to do with
whether they could have fled
the fire because chemicals
given off from the burning
foam rubber of the couch could
have lulled the couple to sleep.
Leonard likened the effect of
the near-odorless fumes to
carbon monoxide from a car.
“If you are in your car and
have a leak in the muffler sys-
tem, the fumes can get in the
car and knock you out,”
Leonard said.
Leonard said the couple
could have been sitting in the
living room watching televi-
sion when the fumes dazed
em.
They could have been
slightly awake, but not fully
aware of what was going on,
he said.
As to the cause of the fire
Leonard said “it was probably
from a cigarette from the
ashtray falling onto the
couch.” =
Leonard said the filter er
of several cigarettes w
found underneath the coi
and that area has been det
mined to be where the )
started.
Rogers said the Irvine F
Department received the 1
at 8:30 p.m. when a volunt
fireman, traveling on Ky.
saw the smoke and radioed
the station for help.
Both Irvine and E:
County fire departme

managed to contain it wit
five minutes.
Rogers said he calls
state police whenever
works a large fire or one t
causes a fatality.
