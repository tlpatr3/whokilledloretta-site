Mickey Reed, the alleged
murderer of Loretta Lynn Wil-
lough¥y, was denied a lower
bond in Estill Circuit Court,
last Friday, but another bond
hearing has been set for Oct.
24,
Reed’s court appointed at-
torney, William Chambliss,
said that Reed’s mother could
provide a $10,000 property
bond to insure that Reed show
at all hearings.
Reed is currently in the Es-
till County Jail on $50,000
cash or property bond.
Chambliss said a lower bond
should be set because “he is
not guilty and will not be
found guilty...he will be stay-
ing in jail for sufficient amount
of time just because he is
poor.” Zi
Chambliss also cited Reed’s
cooperation with the inves-
tigators of the case, saying
that Reed passed a polygraph
test and did not leave during
the investigation.

the bond originally set by the
court is the minimum bond set
for the type of crime for which
Reed is charged.
Circuit Court Judge Ed
Jackson denied the lowering of
the bond without a bond hear-
ing.
“We could have a bond hear-
ing today, but you need certain
witnesses,” Jackson said.
