Dear Sound Off: If the per-

much about the Willoughby
girl's murder would tell
what they know to the police
instead of calling Sound Off,
maybe the case would be
. solved. State and local of-
ficials are working on the
éase, but they do need help
from local citizens. So get
off your butt, and either put
up or shut up. Thank you.

surveys are revealing that
Americans now are changing|

According to a report ip

are much more health con-

careful in making

revealed that three out of five
households had changed their

working as hard as they are

wish that they would put half

Walker's case on the
Willoughby case. If they had,
they would have done had a
conviction on it. They had as
much ‘proof on the

I'd like to Sound Off on the

the law and force them to do
something, because one

I was reading the column in
Sound Off in a part that said
we should bring a Ku Klux
Klan into Irvine. It's a good
idea, although it would pro-
bably bring a lot more trou-
ble. The only way we can
clean up Estill County is by
bringing a bit of law enforc-
ment in town. Bring new law
