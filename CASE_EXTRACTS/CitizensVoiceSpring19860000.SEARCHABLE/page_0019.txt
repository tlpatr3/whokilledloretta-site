ed over this. Whenever they
are in there they are not
learning anything; they're
just harassing. I think it’s
silly and should be stopped.
Sound Off
Recently, I’ve been reading
in the paper about people
wanting to start a new band.
Well, I want to also. I’m not
17 or 18, I'm 21 and I've been
working as hard as they are
to get a conviction on the
murder of Bob Walker. I just
wish that they would put half
the effort they put on Bob
Walker's case on the
Willoughby case. If they had,
they would have done had a
conviction on it. They had as
much ‘proof on the
Willoughby murder as they
with a band before. I'd ]ke®had
on Walker's murder, but
to start a new heavy metal
band, and if you're in-
terested call 4351.
Sound Off
I'd like to Sound_Off on the
murder of Bob Walker. I'm
glad the police officers are
they didn’t carry it on out. I
don’t think it's justice. I
think the people in Estill
County .ought to get behind
the law and force them to do
something, because one
murder is just as bad
—
another, They put the little
girl up in the woods for the
animals to eat. At least Bob
Walker was found the day he
was shot.

I was reading the column in
Sound Off in a part that said
we should bring a Ku Klux
Klan into Irvine. It’s a good
idea, although it would pro-
bably bring a lot more trou-
ble. The only way we can
clean up Estill County is by
bringing a bit of law enforc-
ment in town. Bring new law
into Estill County who isn't
already paid off by bootleg-
gers and drug pushers.
