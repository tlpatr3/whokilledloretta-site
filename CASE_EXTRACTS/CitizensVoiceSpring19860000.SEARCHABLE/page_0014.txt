I think there should be
something done about all the
crimes going on here in Est-
ill County. If something isn’t
done now, then I don’t think
it ever will be. Too many
people are getting killed,
and I think there should be
some justice done.
-Sound Off-
In response to a Sound Off
call last week: I totally
agree with other citizens
about the fire department.
Don’t waste our tax money
on a new fire. department.
Use the money on other
buildings that are falling
down. They have a nice place
to stay.

Since Feb. 10, 1986, it has
been one year Sunday since
Loretta Willoughby disap-
peared on Sunday, Feb 10,
1985. Loretta’s family isn’t
‘king for money, and to the
old biddy who said Loretta
Willoughby wasn't a child,
but a woman: yes, she hada
child when she was 14 years
old. That doesn't make her a
woman in years at 15 to her
family. She was a girl, and
one they loved very much.
Just because they never
found out the truth about
your daughter and what hap-
pened to her; do you really
want them to fail in finding
what happened to Loretta
and who was the one or ones
who murdered her? Are you
as selfish as you sounded? If
so, why don't you spend your
time stil] trying to find out
what happened to your
daughter? Just as we haven't
given upon finding Loretta’s
murderer, and for your in-
formation, we may be a lot
closer than you know. We
have stopped giving what in-
formation we have to the law
because they didn't care.
Loretta Willoughby’s murd-
erer is still out there. The
law never really tried to find.
out anything. It required too.
much time and effort, and it:
might have stepped on too
many big toes. Why did
Montie Parks take all the
information on the Willough-
by'case with him when he left
office? What possible use
could it be to him? Now, will
we see any change now that
we have a new Sheriff? I
realize it will be hard for
him to start without any in-
formation on the case and
find a lead. But will he do it
anyway with all the odds
against him? All we candoas
far as the law is concerned is
wait and see and keep on
working on it. Just as I’m do-
ing. There’s been a lot of
leads, some I’ve eliminated.
So the lst is a lot shorter
and it’s getting narrowed
down toa very few who could
have done it. Is it true that
someone living in Estill
County has a tape telling who
killed Loretta Willoughby?
Was it made just in case
something happened to the
person who knew who her
murderer was? Is it true itis
locked in an out-of-the-way
cabin until time to use it?
Where could this person
have gotten this tape and”
when will it be played again?
How many people know about
this tape and what does it
say? Who or how many does it
name? She dissappeared on
Sunday afternoon, late on
Feb. 10, 1985 and her body
was found in Winns Woods off
Broadway on May 10, 1985.
Who did this? Do you know?
If you do, please write to
some of her family telling
them what you know. I’m
sure they are waiting to hear
from you.
