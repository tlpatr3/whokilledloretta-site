State Legislature “by
Representative Clarence D.
Noland Jr.
The legislature's pace
quickened considerably dur-
ing the second week of the
General Assembly's 1986
Regular Session with nearly
500 bills already having been
introduced for consideration.
Both the House and Senate
took action on several bills
and many other proposals
began to move through the
committee system. i$
Also, the budget-making
process commenced \and
since all budget bills must
originate
in the House, the Ap-
propriations and Reveniie
committee has begun the
complex and often lengthy
task of reviewing and revising
budget legislation. :
Looming on» the
legislature’s hogizon are
issues created by the Toyota
Motor Corporation's decision
to locate million auto-
assembly plant in Kentucky.
Paramount among these
issues is the financial-
incentive package the Collins’
administration has offered
the Japanese automaker,
which could cost the state as
much as $300 million over 20
years. -
$800 million, by anyone's
standards, is a gigantic incen-
tive, even for the several
thousand jobs that will be
created. Kentucky desperate-
ly needs the jobs, but some
basic ground rules must
be established.
As a starting*point in this
regard the House Republican
Caucus has endorsed a resolu-
early
tion urging Toyota to use
American expertise and labor
in the design
and construction ©
of the Japanése automobile
plant. ne g
House Concurrent Resolu-
tion 28, introduced by |
Republican Représentatives,
asks Toyota, to strive to
empléy- American workers,
engineers, architects and con-
tractors whenever possible | ©
for the’purpose of: designing
and constructing the plant. F
The resolution, although
conceived by Republicans,
quickly gained support from
Democratic legislators and
\p--the Govergor’s staff. Obvious-
ly, the ediate popularity
of the measure emphasizes |
the’ fact that the legislature,
indeed,
hire | Americans
preferably Kentuckians as
much as possible during and
after construction of the
plant.
Also, it is Qbvious that the~
legislature would be less sup-
portive of the financial incen-
tive package if Toyota does
not respond to the call for us-
ing Americans in design and
construction of the plant.
And, it has been suggested
that the legislature link ap-
pfoval of the financial incen-
tives to the percentage of
American made parts used at
the assembly plant.
It is good to see the
legislature stand united on
such an important issue and
like the old saying goes, ‘‘You
either stand for ‘something or
you'll fall for anything."’

I would just like to say
thanks to the new sheriff's
department. I have seen
them on Barnes Mountain
patrolling every* night or
every other night. The com-

cleaned up. Flynn’s depart-
ment has kept their word and
honesty is something rarely
found. I really appreciate
the job they are doing.

Talking about cleaning up
the town, the one thing that is
needed is a dog pound. One
can’t walk or drive through
town for the dogs or keep your
yard half way clean. If lhada
hog in town the police would
be here immediately but a
hog is no more of a mess than
a dog. Build a dog pound or
pass a law that everyone who
owns a dog should have a
fenced in area for their dog.
If people can’t afford a fenc-
ed in area let them do
without the: dogs. People
can’t even dry clothes
in the
yard for the dogs pulling them
off the lines.
