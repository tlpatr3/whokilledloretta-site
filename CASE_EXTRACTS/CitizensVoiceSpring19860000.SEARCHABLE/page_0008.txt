~ Sound Off 723-7272
I was reading the Sound Off
where someone put
something about the little
Willoughby. girl that was
found some time back killed
and why whoever killed her
hadn't been found, I was hop-
ing after the first of the year
when the law officials chang-~
ed around that we would be
lucky enough for someone to
pick it up and make an arrest:
I think it was a shame the way
the little body was found and
nothing has been done about
it. It looks like to me if they.
can catch a bank robber that
robs a bank or even
something as small as a
bootlegger. They'll catch
them and fine them for being
a bootlegger or if you drink a
beer and drive they're always
smart enough to catch them
80 it looks like someone has
been covering up some things
somewhere about the death of
a little girl. I think it'll be
necessary for people to starta
fund raising drive
to try to get
some money and get the one
arrested that murdered the
little girl. Let's hear from you
people who have kids and~
“know the love of kids because
‘that little Willoughby girl’s
parents loved her like we love
- ours, so itittakes it, let's start
making money up and hire
some law official to work a lit-
tle harder and get something
~,done.

T’d like to comment and say
that I think we have some fine
policemen with the exclusion
of a few. I'd like to say that
I’m sorry to hear that Dan
Ferguson was injured in the
line of duty, but I would like to Y'
say that he was man enough
not to take something from
the nm who injured him
that he couldn't give back.
-Sound Oft-
I think the Engineer pep
_ band should stay and play
through the whole varsity
game instead of just the first
‘~half. That really makes me
«mad. They get the crowd up
and cheering and then they
j leave. I think if they are going
t6.do that they “should just
stay home because it doesn’t
do any good. I think they have
been doing a good job and
they should be commended
for this, but who is that lazy
director?
-Sound Off-
_We teenagers enjoy reading
Sound Off, but older people
are always talking about us
teenagers and criticize things
“that we do. Well, I have a
-néighbor that’s close to 60
years old. She tries to pretend
she is 14. I happen to know
-that she called in Citizen
“Voice and Times and said
some jewelry she had was
stolen. She reported it to her
insurance company and she
drawed an insurance check on
it and then she had_ her
* jewelry on trading post for
sale. Well, I don’t think there
are any teenagers that would
do something that low down
and sorry. So why do people
keep talking about teenagers
when people as old as this
women are doing things like
_ this?
- Sound Of-
I'd like to comment on the
lady from, Jackson County
who thought her boyfriend
‘was just going on Locomotive.
I'd just like for you to know
Hon that he goes to Cedar
Grove and up on Elm Street in
Ravenna.
-Sound Off-
I'd like to comment onthe
telephone rates. I'd like to say
that our telephone rates keep
going up and I don't think it’s
fair for a business to operate
out of what's supposed to be a
pfivate home with telephone
rates when they are a
business. They should have to
have business rates and that
way us poor people can pay
regular rates.
-Sound Off-
* Yes, I'd like to ask a ques-
tion on how can a woman be
so blind. Surely after a woman-~
has lived with a man for years.
that she'd have to know that
he is vulgar and makes passes
at female family members.
I'd like to say that if I thought
my husband had insulted a
female member of my family
I wouldn't overlook it, I'd be
woman enough to do
something about it. :
-Sound Off:
I'd like to comment on the
lady who was sued for $218.12
“for back taxes here in the city
of Irvine. I'd just like to com-
pliment her on how nice the.
mayor is looking. I saw him in ©
a suitiand a pair of nice shoes.
I'd just like to say that she
must have had enough from
the election to have bought
him a new outfit. Keep the.
good work up, our new mayor.
-Sound Oft-
I'd like to Sound Off about
the children who have to go in
and out of the rooms outside
at West Irvine. They are get-
ting sick and I don’t see why
ou don’t do something to pro-
tect the children. They have a
bus that they have fixed up
like a mansion and they can’t
use it, looks like they could.”
-Sound Off- -
I'd like to comment on the
lady that throws off on her
family and says that she has a
good working husband that
keeps her up and that her.
family who isn’t as fortunate
that she talks about I'd just
like for her to know to never
go up one side that eanit
1 back down.‘ ieee
if you woutd ry”
where ‘you belong you could
get a boyfriend and keep him.
-Sound Oft-
I would like to say that
there are no girls on Loco-
motive Street, they are all
women. I think Sound Off is
great and I love the Citizen
Voice and Times.
*__ -Sound Off-
I'd like to comment on the
pep band that plays at the
Estill County ball games. I
think they should play
together and show the spirit of
Estill County.
-Sound Off- 5
I'd like to Sound Off about
the city policemen riding peo-
ple around. It's not fun to be a
policeman. I think it causes a
disturbance to ride around.
‘They don't have any business,
the way I see it, riding around
and causing more trouble.
‘They should tend to their own
business and stop being so
nosy interfering with the
policeman’s business. If they
were home or out some place
working instead of depending
on other people. I think the
police force would be a lot bet-
ter off.
-Sound Off-
I would like to comment on
those complaining about the
people who got the $280.00
from a church for Christmas.
If the people,are not guilty
why are they wasting their
time answering back Sound
Off? I know it’s a good thing
people in need, but if the peo-
ple would take it for what they
need instead of what they
want; they would be in a lot
better shape. As for TV cable,
I consider it as a want instead
of a necessity especially whén
there are people in Estill
County that need wood and
food for their children and
maybea toy given because it
was Christmas. People keep
complaining in the paper that
they have no heat or food for
the kids when, you live in
Hickory Hills. If you are there
under under low income, your
heat is free and that is your
gas The people receive the
energy money and most of the
people don’t have to pay rent

their electric may be $20.00.

shame they can do this.
-Sound Off-
to get that and let this money I believe the woman who
go to someone who really called in-about Loretta Lynn
needed the money and if they Willoughby about those four
would’ make money by the people who haven't been con-
when a church tries to help asweat Of their brow instead of victed. I believe this person
being a sponge. Every year
it's the same old thing and one
~they can get it settled. If they
ofthese days they are going to
call wolf and no one's going to
be. there to help them. Its a
shame they had to bring the
church into something like
this because all people don’t
live good and the majority of
theff’are liars. If some of the
people in Hickory Hills would
find jobs they would see that
$20.00 is not much to come up
with for electric because
there are people in the city
who have been laid off and
maybe the money could have
gone to help them. Why worry
about a T.V.? When the
children are small they
should be taught manners.

the initials of the people guilty

If you work for a man, in
heavens name work for him.
If he pays you wages that sup-
ply you your bread and but-
ter, work from him, speak well
of him, think well of him,
stand by him and stand by the
institution he represents. I
think If I worked for a manI
would work for him. I would
not work for him part of the
time and the rest of the time

I would just like to know
how a woman could live with
a man who wouldn’t even
speak to her knowing that he
loves and wants someone
else. I’d like to know the pur-
pése of forcing a man to live
with her.
