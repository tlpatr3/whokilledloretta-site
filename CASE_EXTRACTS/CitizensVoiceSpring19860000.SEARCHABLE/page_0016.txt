T agree with the person in ot
Sound Off about Loretta's
murder. Did they check the I
five-gallon bucket in the u
bathroom where she was th
supposed to have visited? in,
The stink in the old house is m
awful. They should have a
taken pictures of the two men g
who were living there with if
her aunt at the time. Didthey w
check the black curly hair d
that was all over the an
bedroom? I doubt it. The aw So
can get the murderer of a cop kn
but doesnâ€™t care about the
murder of a little girl. It's a
rotten town anymore. co
