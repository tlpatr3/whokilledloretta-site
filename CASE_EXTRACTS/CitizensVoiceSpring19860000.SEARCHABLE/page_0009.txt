I was reading the Sound Off
where someone put
something about the little
Willoughby girl that was
found some time back killed
and why whoever killed her
hadn't been found. I was hop-
ing after the first of the year
when the law officials chang- >
"ed around
that we would be
lucky enough for someone to
pick it up and make an arrest.
I think it was a shame the way
the little body was found and
nothing has been done about
it. It looks like to me if they.
can catch a bank robber that -
robs a bank or even
something as small as a
bootlegger. They'll catch
them and fine them for being
a bootlegger
or if you drink a
beer and drive they're always
“smart enough to catch them
so it looks like someone has
been covering up some things
. somewhere about the death of
@ little girl. I think it'll be
necessary for people to starta
fund raising drive to try to get
gome money and get the one
arrested that murdered the
little girl. Let's hear from you -
people who have kids and~
“know the love of kids because |
that little Willoughby girl's |
its loved her like we love
- ours, so itit takes it, let's start
making money up and hire
some law official to work a lit-
tle harder and get something
