You don’t go around town
with your eyes and ears open
that you don’t find out a lot
about what goes on behind
closed shutters and locked
doors.

I wish that people would stop
making lies up on each other.
Down here at the South Irvine
school, I have a friend who is
always making up lies on me.
She says that I make prank
calls all the time, but I don’t
even have a phone. I have to~son who's
come over and use -my. County whi
daddy's momma's. I think itis
plumb: nonsense to make up
Hes to get someone in trouble.
I wish the person who did that
would stop. -

Dear Sound Off: Toute like
to sound off about people who
marry, have_kids and think
that somebody in the family
should always be willing to
take them off their hands so
they can go out and have a
good, free time themselves,
never giving it a thought that
maybe, just maybe, that per-
son wants some free time to
do things for themselves that
they never get to do. Ilove my
grandbabies, but I have a life
too: Let me live it as I want to
sometimes. Thank you.

I'd just like to say that I'd like
for some of these women
around here to look up the
definition of mother. And I
think that before a woman
should put on her mother's
ring and wear it, she should
consider what a mother is. A
mother is a woman who see's
that a child is bathed, and
feed's it, and washes its hair,
and eleans its ears, washes its
clothes and cleans its shoes
for school, and js thereto say,
“T love you,” and to pick that
child up when it falls down.
‘There's more to being a
mother than just having a
child. I’d like to say that a
mother wiio has deserted
on, wearing it around holler-
ing that she’s a mother, she
needs her finger cut off, ring
and all. =

I’d like to call in about the lit-
tle W: hby girl. The peo-
ple of Estill County should get
together and have something
done to find the murderer. If
it would have been some of
their own, I’m sure we would
have something done. We're
going to have to’face it some
way or somehow. And the per-
it loose in Estill
k the girl's life
might have to admit it, but in
ways I think Irvine should at
‘least hold their lights and try
to get some officer in who
could find out who took the
rl's life. They don’t need it
in Estill County. If we don’t
build our hometown up, it’s
never going to build itself.

‘One of our great philosophers
once said, “He who talks
more, knows less; and he who
talks less, knows more.”

Alpo ads say that they don’t
cost more than any other. It's
kind of like cooks: A good cook
doesn’t cost any more than
the"poor cook.
Sound Off
Loretta Willoughby's mother
and grandmother live at 110
Church Street in Irvine, if
‘anyone wants to contact
them. Thank you.
Sound Off
I think that teachers ought to
stop telling kids to have
respect for them, when they
need to have respect for the
children in their class.

To the person who complain-
ed about all the ugly, long-
haired hippies that stand on
the street corner, all of them
don't happen to be ugly.
Sound Off
I don’t think people should be
putting down Meade’s Do-It
Center, because Kroger
decided to give up their
just as much right to it as
anybody else. There's two
sides to this. Kroger had to be
one of them, and they had to
give it up. So, Meades took
it.

If people are concerned about
trying to round up the
murderer or the murderers of
the little Willoughby girl, I
wonder if they would take a
little bit of time for a rum-
mage sale in the courthouse,
if they would donate the stuff
they are not using to be sold.
If they're concerned enough
to donate some stuff for a
rummage sale, please sound
off in the Sound Off, and let's
get it started by April 1. I en-
joy reading Sound Off. It’s a
fine paper.
Sound Off
I would like to ask 3 ques-
tions, and if you can answer
them, please sound off. First,
I'd like to know what
restaurant in Estill County
buys commodity cheese. Two,
how much do they give for it?
‘Three, are they afraid of get-
ting caught?
Sound Off
I'd like to sound off to the per-
son in last week’s paper who
complained about cashiers
smoking ‘at the local super-
market. © gne, smoke at
the local supermarket. It isn’t
like I haves 2 big cigarette
hanging outof my mouth, and
when you Some through my
line I ¢ a real big drag and
blow it*in your face. Thank
ess smoke doesn’t come
out in streams, it just might
put your eyes out, mightn't it.
‘Then you wouldn't know who
we are. Think about it. It
could be worse. It could be a
cigar, pipe or a chew.

I think the person who said
that the band was trying to
compete with the
cheerleaders is crazy. The
band does not have anything
to compete against. It is easy
to twist.your butt and scream,
not easy blowing
children, with a mother's
ring building, and Meade's has but it
A
your brain out. Thanks.
Sound Off
I read with interest the com-
ment about a certain family
‘begging money for their and
others various misfortunes,
and I'm glad someone saw fit
to speak out about this. The
relatives, friends, neighbors
and local churches were very
generous to these people when
they first asked for
assistance, but it soon
became apparent they were
ripping us all off. I do not
know howto stop this, but sug-
gest that everyone do what
their family ‘has since done,
and shun them. Shun them as
you would a leper.

Mayor Shearer, the town can
never be kept clean until
something is done about the
dogs. Evgn the people whoput
out their garbage in cans have
dogs that manage to turn over
the cans and makea terrible
mess. This town will never
look nice until an ordinance is
made that everyone keep
their dogs on their own pro-
perty.

Hey heavy metal man. I think
you should be listening to the
preacher instead of cussing
him out. What's wréng? Does
the truth hurt?
*\ Sound Off
I would like for someone in
Estill County to reply and tell
me if a Martha Washington, 1
1-cent postage stamp is worth
anything, if they are of any
value at all to stamp collec-
tors?
