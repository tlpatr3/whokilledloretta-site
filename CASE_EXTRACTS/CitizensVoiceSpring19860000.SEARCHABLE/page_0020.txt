This ts concerning the peo-
ple who walk the Exill
County track. If you don’t
like {t, you don’t have to
walk it every day.

I remember some 52 years
ago, a father was talking to
his sons. I heard talk of a
marshal being gunned down
on Main Street in Irvine. I
just think we ought to
remember those who lost
their lives in Ravenna. All
this is past history. Now our
children walk the streets.
We want to protect them.
May I ask who do we call?
The law officials. What do
we get? Our finest officer
had to die for justice. What
do we do? We should all get
together and march on the
courthouse and demand
justice. And put forward an
example for our loved ones.
Stand by our officers with
respect. Let's do everything
we can for the city of Irvine,
Ravenna, Estill County and
the state of Kentucky.

I’m calling concerning the
little Willoughby girl” who
‘was murdered. Some say she
was a girl, some'say she was
a woman. Although she hada
baby when she was 14, does
that give anybody a right to
murder her? If it‘does, about
50 percent of! our women
would have to be murdered. I
think the citizens of Estill
County should form a com
mittee, take up money and
hire a private detective ‘to
find out who-killed this girl.
I feel like this girl had a
right to live as much as
anybody else. If there are
enough concerned citizens in
Estill County, I'd like for
them to answer back in
Sound Off.

I'd like to let a little steam
off about the so-called sixty-
niners. Everytime a case
comes up that amounts to
anything, they'll put their
nose in state police's
business and bust the
evidence.Like what happen-
ed on a murder of a little
girl. They couldn't be
satisfied unless they put
their nose in it. I think that
they should keep their nose
out of it. They’re not
qualified in the first place,
like me. All they're
qualified to do is loaf around
town and be in the officials
way. And these people who
are not bonded that are
riding around with the city
police. I think it's a shame
and a disgrace, because it
only makes the ones they
stop mad to where they don’t
want to go to jail and then the
police have to use force. It's
a shame. ‘
Sound Off
I'd like to Sound Off about
neonle going around asking
* league basketball.
for money and not using it
for what they said they were.
They're out asking for-
money to pay for doctor bills
when they already have a
medical card to pay them
with. And another thing,
during election “you can't
walk the streets for this
family bumming-~ money.
‘They only take the money and
go buy them a new car with
it., They didn’t have too much
respect for old Bob Walker,
because the same outfit was
outside ‘trying to get money
for sormebody
« wher their
house biirned. They should
have had enough respect un-
til poor old Bob was put
away: Sound Oft
I dove to read Sound Off.
Keep up the good work, Hat-
Held: Sound Off
I'd like to know why we
have 4-H and we don't have
our meetings? i
Sound Off
Mr. Lee, I like that you are
doing a fine job in church
But 1
have a few questions to ask.
One church you know well, is
giving ball players money to
come home to play ball. One
this year caine from Rich:
mond, and one last year
came from Ohio. Is this what
church league is all about?
Who is in control of the
ballgames on the court? The
officials. I’ve seen the of-
ficials more worried about
the spectators than tlie
ballgame. Tell the spec-
tators to shut up or leave the
gym. They can't call a foul
on the court. Because the
more fouls that are called,
the later they go home. Two
players hit each other Feb.
22. What happened? The of-
ficials called a foul on one
and asked them to sit down
until they could cool down. I
guess what I'm really asking
is what church league is all
“about. Is it win, win, win or
how you play, the game? I
would like to know who is go-
ing to recruit Dan Issel from
Lexington? I would, like to
say that all teams in church
league have some problems,
not one or two. And thanks
for taking the league two
years ina row.
Sound Off
I would like to comment on
the person who was throwing
off on the mayor who said
they couldn’t get outside
because their road wasn’t
clear. I'd like to say I'ma
working person and ‘I clear
my own sidewalk to get my
own car out to work. Did you
have an appointment at the
food stamp office and were
you late getting down there?
None of our other mayors
have been responsible for
the weather situation or if
people got to and from work.
Sound Off
I think it’s a shame that the
Buck Creek roads are in
such bad shape that it takes
15 minutes for a fire truck to
get up here to put out'a fire. I
think they ought to have them
fixed
Sound Off
I'd like to comment on Guy's
voice on the recorder. I think
it's a real sweet voice.
Sound Off
Somebody has been dumping
garbage at the Spark’s
cemetary where my mother
and daddy are buried. I'd
like to ask them please not to
let it happen any more.
Sound Off
Will the family of Loretta
Willoughby please leave an
address or somewhere
where they can be contacted?
Sound Off
While mourning the death of
an outstanding public ser-
vant, let us remember our
previous police chief who
was also shot down on Main
Street a few years ago and
has a permanent disability
as a result of that injury. I
think sometimes we tend to
toss those people aside who
have given their best, just
like an old shoe. Thank you
Marcus Cole for a job well
sone: Sound Off
I think the cashiers at a
local supermarket should
not be allowed to smoke.
People who go through the
line buying items who do not
smoke often get £ irom
the smell of it.°I ink
something shouldbe lone
about it. ; *
Sound ofr
I'm a student atgthe Estill
County High ScHooly and I
would like to comment on the
cheerleaders. I think the
cheerleaders do the best they
can, and it makes me proud
to see them at
a ballgame do-
ing their very best. Some
people put them down
because they get popular
from cheerleading. But I
think they are just jealous.
Sound Off
I think that the band should
stop trying to compete with
the cheerleaders at pep
rallies and ball games
because the chéerleaders
are far better than the band.
Sound Off
I work out of town, and I
haven't been ashariied to tell
anyone where I'm from. But
I now hesitate*to tell them
that I’m from Irvine or
Estill County because of the
vicious things thatshave hap-
pened recently. Egeh time a
shooting takes place it
makes headlines fn the paper
and on television, I dread go-
ing to work and hear them
talk. They really put Irvine
down. People out of town
have always put Irvine
down. I have always defend-
ed my birthplace, but it’s
hard to try to convince peo-
ple that it’s a good place to
live. Just think of all the
shootings and deaths in the
last year or so. Each time
Irvine is a topic of conversa-
tion at work. I feel like going
under the table. We need
trained people to clean up
this place. I feel most of the
trouble is caused by drugs
and alcohol. :
Sound Off
In answer to the person who
said Sound Off is the worst
thing that ever happened to
Estill County and said it was
evil. Well, you must be as
evil as the rest of us; you us-
ed it didn’t you. I love Sound
Off. No one is made to call
and say their peace. You
couldn't resist the tempta-
tion to try out your big. jaws
either. I love you Sound Off.
Sound Off
For the woman who said
that she has to wear’ her
drawers till they rot. It’s
her own fault.
Sound Off
I enjoy reading Sound Off,
and thanks for the nice
things -you put in it. I feel
like our Patrolman Miller
did a good job controlling
traffic at Carhartts.
Thursdays are always a big
hassle getting out. But to-
day, he did a great job mov-
ing the traffic along.
Sound Off
Iam a teenager also. ‘have
long, blond hair. I would like
to tell the other teenager
this. Honey, you've got a lot
to learn. I’m a heavy metal
listener too, but that doesn’t
give me the right to go and_
cuss a preacher. If you just
keep quiet, you might learn«
something. They've lived
longer than you have, so I
suggest you learn some
respect. Anyway, If you
don’t like church, don’t go.
‘This is for all preachers'who
have to put up with the ig-
norance from_ those
teenagers. I'm a teenager
too, but I've learned my
lesson Sound Off
To the one who commented
about younger people not
respecting their elders. I
would like you to know if I
respect anyone it's the older
people in the community. I
am 15, and I go to the nursing
home three to four times a
week. I enjoy talking ‘to
them. If anybody should
respect someone, it should
be the old people respecting
the young. The only thing
they call us is pot heads and
drug pushers. If that’s not
enough, they call our music
devil music. So I think it’s
time for the younger people
to take a stand.
Sound Off
I'd like to kind of answer
about what someone said
about Loretta’s death. It
seems that whoever said
that knew an awful lot about
it. They. said there was
black, curly hair in the
bedroom, and they talked
about how the bucket in the
bathroom smelled. It seems
like they know enough that
they should tell the good,
upstanding law officials
which would be the state
police in the county. It could
lead to the solution of the lit-
tle girl’s murder.
