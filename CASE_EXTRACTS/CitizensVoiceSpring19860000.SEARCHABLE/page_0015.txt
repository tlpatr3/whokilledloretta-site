Welfare, welfare, welfare.
That's all you ever hear in
this newspaper. Well, I tell
you, when you're on welfare
you don't wear designer
jeans. You don’t even buy a
new pair of drawers. You
wear them till they rot.

First, I'd like to say that I
really enjoy Sound Off and
the Citizen Voice & Times.

mayors. Now if we could suet

I'd like to Sound Off about
the person wanting someone
to join in to form a heavy
metal band. My influences
are also Kiss and Motley

I agree with the person in
Sound Off about Loretta’s
murder. Did they check the
five-gallon bucket in the
bathroom where she was
supposed to have visited?
‘The stink in the old house is
awful. They should have
taken pictures of the two men
who were living there with
her aunt at the time. Did they
check the black curly hair
that was all over the
bedroom? I doubt it. The law
can get the murderer ofa cop
but doesn’t care about the
murder of a little girl. It's a
rotten town anymore.

I glance through the CV&T

I enjoy the Sound Off col-
