Friends of Life makes news -
take a turn for the better
It isn’t often that we
have the opportunity to
publish good news. That
is not to say that ‘‘good’’
news is scarce. It’s just
that there is only so
much space in a
newspaper, and most of
the news which must
receive priority, for a
number of reasons, is
bad.
However, this week
we are pleased to be able
to report on an activity
involving high school
students which restores.
in us an optimism about
our youth and, therefore,
our future.
We recommend that,
you take time to read a
story herein about the
Friends of Life

County High School with

Arts proposal exciting idea
An exciting proposal
was given to the Estill
County Board of Educa-
tion Monday night, one
which it should make
every effort to imple-
ment.
Representatives of the
Estill County Arts Pro-
ject asked the board for
$4,500 to go toward local
funds needed to match
grants the group has
received.
Plans for the project’s
$27,000 budget include,
the establishment of an
art gallery here,
House wastes no time so far
Time can tear down a
building or destroy a pretty
face, hours are precious so
don't let them waste.
The House of Represen-
tatives has wasted little time
during the 38 legislative days
to have fun without
drugs and alcohol. :
As the story will tell
you, FLO -ia, an
outgrowth of a» multi-
state effort called ‘‘Pro-
ject Graduation.” This
effort began in 1980 with
the shocking death of 7
students in Maine who
were-involved in a tragic
automobile accident in
which the excessive con-
sumption of alcohol was
a factor.
Project Graduation in
Kentucky is being spon-
sored by the Kentucky
State Police and the
Department of Educa-
tion. These government
agencies are: providing
technical help’ to
teenagers .in local
schools, informing them
of the hazards of
substance abuse, and en-
couraging them to
organize at least one
werkshops for students
with instruction from an
“artistin residence’ and
even a theater group.
Appalachian art, the
stated emphasis of the
proposed gallery and
workshops, would pro-
vide a vehicle through
which a greatly needed
sense of pride in com-
munity and region could
develop.
Also, art programs at
local schools could be
enhanced by an oppor-
tunity for area students
to publicly display their
work.

There are several other
wital nracrams we hone to in-
night of drug and
alcohol-free entertain-
ment.
®* Bstill County
students, with the
energetic, undying en-
couragement of teacher
Sharon Niece, are plann-
ing an all-night party
after the prom in May.
If that shocks anyone,
it shouldn’t. All night
parties have long been
the custom after proms
and graduation
ceremonies. Giving one
which will be enjoyable
and drug and alcohol-
free is a wonderful idea.
We tip our hats to them.

becomes a successful an-

should be pursued with

with an interest in
theater ‘must’ travel

A contribution of j
$4,500 is a mere pittance
in relation to the poten-*

The school board
should, however, study
such quality before

To the Editor,
To the person who is call-
ing Sound Off concerning
Loretta Lynn Willoughby’s
death:
Tam glad to know you are
interested in the death of
Loretta Willoughby. You
must have a great concern.
T feel that if your concern is
'* as deep as it appears, you
Twill not have'any problems
| or reservations about going
before the Estill County
Grand Jury and telling all
that you know.
,. It appears from your
sound off calls that you
have evidence that could be
used in the apprehension
*and conviction of the four
people that you indicated
were involved in her death.
I'm sure you wouldn’t
care to give the Grand Jury
or authorities the names of
those that were involved in
her death.
It appears that you want
to give the local authorities
a black eye, when you are
the person they are looking
for -- for the answers. You
stated in one of your calls
that you were carrying out
your own investigation, and
that you had eliminated
several leads,
have narrowed it down,
that you were ready to
break the case, and that it
would do no good to give it
to the police because they
wouldn’t do anything.

So what do you intend to
do with the evidence? Are
you going to make the ar-
rest\yourself, or are you
just \going to go on
mouthing? I guess you
realize! that if you are
withholding information,
and if your identity is learn-
ed, you can be charged with
obstructing justice. So,
_ what do yoy intend to do?
The Irvine Police Depart-
ment got the initial report
of Loretta's disappearance,
shortly after she was
discovered missing. My of-
fice at the time, the Estill
County Sheriff's Office,
was later advised of the
situation.
We did try to locate
Loretta. We also put her
name in the computer at
the Kentucky State Police,
with all the necessary in-
formation, as a missing
person. The Irvine police
and our office were work-
ing to locate Loretta. Then
her body was found in town
on the hill behind John
Winn’'s garage.
We notified the Kentucky
State Police, and they sent
detectives in to work on the
case. All three depart-
ments, the Irvine police,
the sheriff's office and the
state police ran all the
leads that were available to
them. At no time have I
tried to cover up or protect

any person in this case.
I tried to find the person
or persons who committed
this crime against Loretta:.
As to my report on the
Willoughby case, Bob
Walker was as interested in
solving it as was I. So, he
took the report that was at
the sheriff's office with him
so that he could continue
working on the case.
As for the new sheriff,
I've been right here all the
time, If he wanted to know
anything, he knows where I
am. It's not my place to go
to him and tell him what to
do. There would be no pro-
blem getting any informa-
tion he would need from the
Irvine police or the state
police. I have always found
them more than willing to
share. After all, the report
that I had was from the
state police.
I encourage you to come
forward and give »the
authorities the information “
you have. Perhaps the case
could have been solved long
ago if you had been willing.

come forward from behind
the Sound Off column and
let your name or names be
known.
