I'd like to know
if they are go-
ing to be having prayer
in the
schools.
{ Sound Off
We love Sound Off and I'd like
to! know when they are going
tohave hamburgers out at the
high school again.

I think that is pretty darn bad
that a kid's mother and father
lets them smoke pot.
A Sound Off
a{think that it is a shame thes.
Bbtill Middle School had only,
one dance. I think that we~
should have four.

pim. I called-the Irvine Fire
Department. They said
“Hello” and told me to hold. I
waited two hours and they
never did come back to me. I
think we should have
something done about this. I
think the Irvine Fire Depart-
mient is one of the worst fire
departments we've had.
t Sound Off
think something ought to be
dpne about the old Irvine
water plant. It’s a dangerous
old, empty building.
i Sound Off
wee the person who got the
cbat at the Wash House Satur-
y night would return it. We
ow who did it. *
+ Sound Off
Ewant to know why J.V. boys
and girls basketball teams
aren't in the paper. After all,
they did win district. Are we
cbnsidered less important
than the varsity?

_ Concerning Lorretta
Willoughby. In last week's
Sound Off someone wanted an
address to cantact some of
her family. So I’m leaving my
address. You can contact me:
Michelle Barnett, Route 3,
Box 437, Stanton, Ky. 40380.
Sound Off
think what we need in Estill
uunty,is another. hanging.
hen we were young we
would hear about someone
getting hanged in Estill Coun-
ty. We need another one to
stop all this crime.
i Sound Off
i really enjoyed the junction
bands that played at the Na-
tional Guard Armory last
week. Guys, you are really
improving. Good luck in the
fyture.
i Sound Off
is to all the ladies who sit
the little restraunt waiting
for the railroaders. Ladies,
dbn't you know that these men
are not going to leave their
wives and families for you?
You are only being used.
Sound Off
ould like to refer to the il-
Vent Aumnine and carhage
'd like to compliment the
erican Legion-on Sunday
night. They did a greatjob on
helping people. Se ee

I'd like to comment on people
who use restaurants’
bathrooms. I'd be ashamed of
myse! just to tramp in a
restal it. just to use the
bathroom, and’ the good peo-
ple who have to clean them
don’t’appreciate them either.
Sound Off
I_was' just kidding about
earing mM; wers till they
rot, but I do have eight small
children. My husband left us
and we draw welfare, and we
don’t draw enough to buy
clothes. I have, two pair of
panties,; one bra, a pair of
bluejeans. I have,to wear my
gown while I wash these and
wait for them to dry and there
is no way anyone\can wear
designer jeans pn welfare. I
sold the furniture, so my
children can have heat.
Sound Off
I am an older person and I
don’t get out to the grocery
very often, but when I do it is
very difficult for me. It séems
like to me there is a girl injone
of the grocery stores here that
is very distasteful. She has a
nasty disposition and. she
doesn’t even know the mean-
ing of the word thank you. It
seems that a young chid of her
age would try to be a little
more pleasant towards people
and try to have a stnile on her
face. I would say that she has
a lot to learn in. this world.
Sound Off
It is not very pleasant to be in
a situation where it is damned
if you do and damned if you
don’t.
Sound Off
I think we the people should
get together and go to
Frankfort about the way the
automobile insurance is go-
ing up.If you have an accident
they raise it to pay for the ac-
cident, and really you don’t
have insurance. You’re pay-
ing them an enormous
amount of money. The gover-
nor. passed the law’ that you
have to have it, and the ones
that are getting rich are the
insurance companies. You
pay for the accident yourself.
It is getting so high people
can't afford it. Let’s do
something about it.
Sound Off
I read in the paper today that
Councilman Jim Haden is try-
ing to get money to clean up
downtown, I don’t blame him.
That gives the load on the tax-
payers back. Since he has had
such a mess in some of his
business, why doesn’t he start
there? In the Spring no one
can get out of their cars
because of the plants he has
sitting on the sidewalk and
now a pop machine. But,
come to think about it, the
problems won't last much
Sound Off
I believe sound off tapes
should be turned over to the
Grand Jury to determine who
is making the calls on the
Loretta Lynn Willoughby
murder. These people should
be indicted for withholding in-
formation, which is a
criminal offense. It is. no
wonder this case is not solved.
It's not law enforcements
fault, it’s people like these
who always want someone
else to do something but they
don’t want to get involved.
‘Who knows, maybe it’s Loret-
ta Willoughby’s murderer and
they are feeling guilty for
what they’ve done. As far as
Bob Walker's murder. There
was no solving to it. When a
manis allegedly going around
threatening a life and then he
and his car are probably are
seen by several at the time at
the scene. I don’t see that here
is anything to solve. It’s pret-
tywell cut and dried, don’t you
think? Another thing, bootleg-
gers and people in the drug
business. Don't blame the law
enforcement. Blame your
sorry Commonwealth At-
torney. Blame your sorry
court system. The law en-
forcement can bring them in
only to havyeghem put back on
the street. ly thing that
is accomplished is that the
parents, ers, sisters or
whateveraye mad at the law
because they arrested them.
‘They somebody else
that bootlegs or sells drugs
and the law didn’t arrest
them. So they go around say-
ing the law.is picking on them.
Everybody sants the police to
get the ones that are doing
wrong but don’t you touch any
of mine. Well, everybody has
someone in their family or
friends thatis doing wrong. So
tell me, who are the police to
arrest? I wouldn't blame law
enforcement in this county if
they didn't do anything. They
go out and risk their lives for
us and get shot down in cold
blood and what thanks do they
get? Hardly any, and they
certainly don't get much pay.
‘There arg some'stupid people
in this county that think: of-
ficergghouldn’t even be allow-
ed td defend their own lives.
You big mouth calling Sound
Off: Get out there and risk
your lifé.. Of course, you
wouldn'tido that because you
are a coward or you would
have gone to the police a year
ago with all that information
you claim to have. If you don’t
have the nerve to do what is
right, then you shouldn’t be
going around talking about so-
meone else.
not find out anything ought to
mind their own business and
stop worrying about other
people and worry about
themselves.
