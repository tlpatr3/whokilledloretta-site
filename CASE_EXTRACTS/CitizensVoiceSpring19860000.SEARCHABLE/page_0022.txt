I'd like to kind of answer
about what someone said
about Loretta’s death. It
seems that whoever said
that knew an awful lot about
it. They said there was
black, curly hair in the
bedroom, and they talked
about how the bucket in the
bathroom smelled. It seems
like they know enough that
they should tell the good,
upstanding law officials
which would be the state
police in the county. It could
lead to the solution of the lit-
tle girl’s murder.
