Former sheriff responds to Sound Off
To the Editor,
To the person who is call-
ing Sound Off concerning
Loretta Lynn Willoughby’s
death:
Tam glad to know youare
interested in the death of
Loretta Willoughby. You
must have a great concern.
T feel that if your concern is
as deep as it appears, you
will not have‘any problems
or reservations about going
' before the Estill County
Grand Jury and telling all
that you know.
It appears from your
‘sound off calls that you
have evidence that could be
used in the apprehension
sand conviction of the four
people that you indicated
were involved in her death.
I'm sure you wouldn’t
care to give the Grand Jury
or authorities the names of
those that were involved in
her death.
It appears that you want
to give the local authorities
a black eye, when you are
the person they are looking
. for -- for the answers. You
stated in one of your calls
that you were carrying out
your own investigation, and
that you had eliminated
“several leads,
have narrowed it down,
that you were ready to
break the case, and that it
would do no good to give it
to the police because they
wouldn't do anything.
that you:
So what do you intend to
“do with the evidence? Are
you ggoing to make the ar-
rest\yourself, or are you
just \going to go on
mouthing? I guess you
realize} that if you are
withholding information,
and if your identity is learn-
ed, you can be charged with
obstructing justice. So,
_what do yoy intend to do?
The Irvine Police Depart-
ment got the initial report
of Loretta's disappearance,
shortly after she was
discovered missing. My of-
fice at the time, the Estill
County Sheriff's Office,
was later advised of the
situation.
We did try to locate
Loretta. We also put her
name in the computer at
the Kentucky State Police,
with all the necessary in-
formation, as a missing
person. The Irvine police
and our office were work-
ing to locate Loretta. Then
her body was found in town
on the hill behind John
Winn's garage.
We notified the Kentucky
State Police, and they sent
detectives in to work on the
case. All three depart-
ments, the Irvine police,
the sheriff's office and the
state police ran all the
leads that were available to
them. At no time have I
tried to cover up or protect
any person in this case.
I tried to find the person
or persons who committed
this crime against Loretta.
As to my report on the
Willoughby case, Bob
Walker was as interested in
solving it as was I. So, he
took the report that was at
the sheriff's office with him
so that he could continue .
working on the case.
As for the new sheriff,
I've been right here all the
time. If he wanted to know
anything, he knows where I
am, It's not my place to go
to him and tell him what to
do. There would be no pro-
blem getting any informa-
tion he would need from the
Irvine police or the state
police. I have always found
them more than willing to
share. After all, the report
that I had was from the
state police.
I encourage you to come
forward and give sthe
authorities the information’
you have. Perhaps the case
gould have been solved long
ago if you had been willing
to share your information.
You must know who did it
or your conscience is
bothering you. I hope you.
will have guts enough to
come forward from behind
the Sound Off column and
let your name or names be
known.
