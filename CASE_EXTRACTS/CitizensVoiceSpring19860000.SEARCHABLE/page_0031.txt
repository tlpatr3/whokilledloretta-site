I believe sound off tapes
should be turned over to the
Grand.Jury to determine who
is making the calls on the
Loretta Lynn Willoughby
murder. These people should
be indicted for withholding in-
formation, which is a
criminal offense. It is. no
wonder this case is not solved.
It's not law enforcements
fault, it’s people like these
who always want someone
else to do something but they
don't want to get involved.
Who knows, maybe it's Loret-
ta Willoughby’s murderer and
they are feeling guilty for
what they’ve done. As far as
Bob Walker’s murder. ‘There
was no solving to it. When a
man is allegedly going around
threatening a life and then he
and his car are probably are
seen by several at the time at
the scene. I don’t see that here
is anything to solve. It’s pret-
tywell cut and dried, don’t you
think? Another thing, bootleg-
gers and people in the drug:
business. Don’t blame the law
enforcement. Blame your
sorry Commonwealth At-
torney. Blame your sorry
court system. The law en-
forcement
can bring them in
only to hayeghem put back on
the street. ly thing that
is accomplished is that the
parents, brothers, sisters or
whatever’aye mad at the law

and the law didn’t arrest
them. So they go around say-
ing the law is picking on them.
Everybody wants the police to
get the ones that are doing
wrong but don't you touch any
of mine. Well, everybody has
someone in their family or
friends that is doing wrong. So
tell me, who are the police to
arrest? I wouldn't blame law
enforcement in this county if
they didn't do anything. They
go out and risk their lives for
us and jget shot down in cold
blood and what thanks do they
get? Hardly any, and they
certainly don't get much pay.

You big mouth calling Sound
Off: Get out there, and risk
your life.. Of course, you
wouldn'tédo that because you
are a coward or you would
have gone to the police a year
ago with all that information
you claim to have. If you don’t
have the nerve to do what is
right, then you shouldn't be
going around talking about so-
