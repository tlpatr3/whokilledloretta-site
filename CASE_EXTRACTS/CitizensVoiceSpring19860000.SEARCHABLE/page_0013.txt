would liketomake a com-
pl against our local health
department. The other day, I
was in there waiting in line
for service. Although, one
lady was working. hard,
three other employees were
discussing what they wanted
for breakfast. I don’t believe
this is any way to run a
business.
V. -Sound Off-
'This is a plea to the people
of Estill County. The things
that are happening in Estill
County are absolutely unfor-.
givable. We the citizens are
to blame. We are allowing
corruption, crime and
murder to take over in our
county. We the people can
stop this. Think twice when
you go to the polls. We've got
to have people in this county
who will:run it and run it
cleanly. We are allowing a
group of people to take over
our county and to let every-
thing happen.
-Sound Off-
Good people should not be
shot downon the street. We've
got to stop that.
-Sound Off-
McClanahan was in there
‘once before. We weren't any
better off when he left than.
when he came in. Why should
there be a change this time?
-Sound Off-
Iama.customer of Jackson
County RECC, andI think itis
a shame that I have to pay
high electric bill each month
in order to pay the salaries of
our two county electricians
who are supposed to be work-
ing for the Jackson County
RECC, but instead they are
always somewhere else.
Come ‘on Jackson County
RECC customers, Sound Off.
-Sound Off-
I wish the people who park
between the school and white
building at the middle school
~ would change parking, be-
cause as a route man, it
causes a traffic hazard as
we try to back onto Main
Street. If they would change
the parking then we could
park in that lot.
-Sound Off-
=: What is* going-to"have:to
happen in this county before
the good people wake up and
take action? A good man is
dead because the courts
would not act. Eight months
ago, this man was indicted
for shooting this same man.
The case has never come to
trial. If it had come to trial,
and if he had been convicted
then he would not have ever
been back on the streets to
commit this crime. How
long can we continue to
uphold the officials who
won't do their duty? If the
courts can't act maybe the
Ku Klux Klan or the vigilan-
ties will. All of us are sheep.
-Sound Off- :
Irvine used to be a county I
was proud to live in. It's a
shame what it has become in
the past year. It's a shame
people won't accept law and
order. It’s terrible when they
kill our police officers. We've
lost one of our best when we
lost Bob Walker. I hope
justice is done.
-Sound Off-
I want to comment on these
women who call the police
all the time about domestic
disturbances. Once you take
amanandusehim
and get all
his money then you should let
him in and take what he
dishes out. I don’t think a
woman should call the police
everytime an ex-husband or
boyfriend looks at her half-
cross, I think they should try
to work things out at home
and not involve innocent peo-
ple.
-Sound Off-
The residents of Grand
and South Madison Avenues
would like. people to stop
throwing their garbage on
the river bank. I, for one ifI
see anyone down there, will
turn their license number
over to the law. -
-Sound Off.
Dear David: I want you to
know -I missed work today
because you failed to-get the
streets cleaned for’ me to
‘leave for work. My street
wasn't cleaned until 10 a.m. 1
pay my, taxes but not any
more. If you can get away
with it for fivd years, so can I.
I say get the lead out and get
the streets cleaned in time for
the people to get to work. We
don't have bankers hours.
Some of us have to leave
home at 5:30. It sure is rough
when the streets are not
cleaned.
-Sound Off-
Sound Off is a good publica-
tion, and I’m glad we have it
here in Estill County: I'd like
to comment on sixth street.in
Ravenna. Every time it has
snowed in the past couple of
years they have left it alone,
a! and the people have gone
sleigh riding on it. They
shouldn’t have graded {t off,
and next time it snows they
should leave it alone. The
children of Estill County have
nothing to do, and sixth street
is their main source of fun.
This little town doesn't have
anything for them to do. The
new mayor of Ravenna
should, and everybody else,
leave sixth street alone.
-Sound Off-
I want to compliment the
highway department on the
good job they have done in
getting the snow off the roads
and also the city administra-
tion for getting the snow off
the roads. They’ve done a
good job.
“Sound Off-
I think that everyone has
the right to their own opinion.
We have a right to exercise
this, and Sound Off lets us.
But when people put other
people down, it makes Sound
Off sound like a gossip col-
umn. I don't think that’s what
Sound Off was meant for. I
don’t believe in printing such
trash in the paper. I think it’s
waisting time_and space ina
wonderful paper.
-Sound Off-
I don’t see why people keep
putting David Shearer down.
They need to give him a
chance to start out; especially
‘with what the ex-mayor left
him to do.
-Sound Off-
I think David Shearer is a
really nice guy. And I'm going
to give him a chance. Why
don’t you give him a chance,
too?
-Sound Off-
I think the CV&T is a great
newspaper. I'm glad that the
citizens of Estill County have
a chance to read such a paper.
Thanks for giving us the
CV&T- :
-Sound Off-
I don’t think the mayor of
Irvine will have to worry with
a parking lot for downtown
merchants if Kroger goes out.
-Sound Off-
If everybody wants the
band to play at halftime, why
don't they clap after we play.
-Sound Off.
People-don't like the new
mayor, but I like him. He
hasn't been; in office long
enough to prove himself. But,
he keeps working hard, even
hough people keep putting
him down. I think he’s going
to_be doing a really fine job if:
you'll give him a chance. I
just want David Shearer to
know I am behind him 100 per-
cent: Thanks a lot David.
-Sound Off-
I was in town the other day,
andd@&ere were two men put-
ting down the new mayor.
They made me sick. They
were talking about how he
didn’t have much money.
Well, it doesn’t take a lot of
money to have a lot of sense.
I’m sure a lot of people think
that our new mayor is dumb,
but I happen to know thathe is
pretty smart. It doesn't mat-
ter if you have money or not.
It’s the jéb that he can do with
his brain, not with all the
money he has.
-Sound Off-
I think it was a wonderfull
idea that the police depart-
ment got new cruisers. I want
the police officers to know
that it makes the town look a
lot better. I think they're even
patroling more since they
have the new cruisers. I hope
they keep up the good work.
-Sound Off-
I'd like to say something
about the fine, concientious
manner in. which the Estill
County Road Department
handled this winter's ice and
snow. They really did fine and
deserve some praise from
those they have served. I'm
one of them. The secondary
and county roads were clean-
ed through our area on Stacy
Lane, while the Pea Ridge
Road, which is a state road,
Now In
Stock...
rat
was ice. Keep it up men.
You're doing fine.
_-Sound Off-
I believe the state
legislators should pass a law
forbidding anyone who hasn’t
paid his taxes or who has
taken bankruptcy from runn-
ing for mayor or county
judge.
-Sound Off-
I'd like to know if there is
anyone around 17 or 18 in-
terested in forming a heavy
metal group. My influences
are Kiss and Motley Crue.
Please Sound Off, and I'll con-
tact you.
-Sound Off-
I don't think anything else
shoud be printed in Sound Off
about the St. Timothy's
Church on Barnes Mt. or
either the clothing store,
because you're only hurting
people. If you are using Sound
Off to hurt someone, then I
don't think people ought to be
reading your paper.
-Sound Off-
I think Sound Off is the
worst thing that ever happen-
ed to Estill County. I think
if the people who won the
paper had any decency at all
they’d stop Sound Off because
it's evil. It gives people a
chance to talk about one
another without talking to
their face. If they can’t talk to
their face, then they shouldn't
tally au.
»-Sound Off-
og the people who are us-
ing ,Sound Off to send
mesiiges, I'd like to send one
them. It is simply this: If
uu go to your bible read Mat-
thew 5: 27-32. Also Matthew
chapter 19. Then, turn over to
the book of Romans, chapter7
and ‘pay particular attention
to verse 3. Then you might
consider turning to Peter II.
Read the whole chapter 2. I
don’t expect to see this in
print, but If I do, I hope that it
Precisi
will be read by those people
who need tovread it.
-Sound Off. -
I think there should be
something done about all the
erimes going on here in Est-
ill County. If something isn’t
done now, then I don’t think
it ever will be. Too many
people are getting killed,
and I think there should be
some justice done.
-Sound Off-
In response to a Sound Off
call last week: I totally
agree with other citizens
about the fire department.
Don’t waste our tax money
on a new fire. department.
Use the money on other
buildings that are falling
down. They have a nice place
to stay.

Since Feb. 10, 1986, it has
been one year Sunday since
Loretta Willoughby disap-
peared on Sunday, Feb 10,
1985. Loretta’s family isn’t
asking for money, and to the
old biddy who said Loretta
Willoughby wasn't a child,
but a woman: yes, she hada
child when she was 14 years
old. That doesn't make her a
woman in years at 15 to her
family. She was a girl, and
one they loved very much.
Just because they never
found out the truth about
your daughter and what hap-
pened to her; do you really
want them to fail in finding
what happened to Loretta
and who was the one or ones
who murdered her? Are you
as selfish as you sounded? If
so, why don't you spend your
time stil] trying to find out
what happened to your
daughter? Just as we haven't
given upon finding Loretta’s
murderer, and for your in-
formation, we may be a lot
closer than you know. We
have stopped giving what in-
formation we have to the law
because they didn’t care.
Loretta Willoughby’s murd-
erer is still out there. The
law never really tried to find
out anything. It required to
much time and effort, and it
might have stepped on too
many big toes. Why did
Montie Parks take all the
information on the Willough-
by case with him when
he left
office? What possible use
could it be to him? Now, will
we see any change now that
we have a new Sheriff? I
realize it will be hard for
him to start without any in-
formation on the case and
find a lead. But will he doit
anyway with all the odds
against him? All we candoas
far as the law is concerned is
wait and see and keep on
working on it. Just as I'm do-
ing. There’s been a lot of
leads, some I've eliminated.
So the list is a lot shorter
and it's getting narrowed
down to a very few who could
have done it. Is it true that
someone living in Bstill
County has a tape telling who
killed Loretta Willoughby?
Was it made just in case
something happened to the
person who knew who her
murderer was? Is it true itis
locked in an out-of-the-way
cabin until time to use it?
Where could this person
have gotten this tape and
when will it be played again?
How many people kriow about
this tape and what does it
say? Who or how many does it
name? She dissappeared on
Sunday afternoon, late on
Feb. 10, 1985 and her body
was found in Winns Woods off
Broadway on May 10, 1085.
Who did this? Do you know?
If you do, please write to
some of her family telling
them what you know. I’m
sure they are waiting tohear
from you.
